 .
 This is a tiny, auditable script that you can throw on your server to issue and

 have access to your private Let's Encrypt account key, the script is kept as
 tiny as possible (currently less than 200 lines). The only prerequisites are
 Python and openssl.

Package: acmetool
Description-md5: 3e5e145ae880b97f3b6e825daf35ce32
Description-en: automatic certificate acquisition tool for Let's Encrypt
 acmetool is an easy-to-use command line tool for automatically
 acquiring TLS certificates from ACME (Automated Certificate Management
 Environment) servers such as Let's Encrypt, designed to flexibly
 integrate into your webserver setup to enable automatic verification.
 .
 acmetool is designed to work like make: you specify what certificates
 you want, and acmetool obtains certificates as necessary to satisfy
 those requirements. If the requirements are already satisfied,
 acmetool doesn't do anything when invoked. Thus, acmetool is
 ideally suited for use on a cron job; it will do nothing until
 certificates are near expiry, and then obtain new ones.
 .
 acmetool is designed to minimise the use of state and be transparent
 in the state that it does use. All state, including certificates, is
 stored in a single directory, by default /var/lib/acme. The schema
 for this directory is simple, comprehensible and documented.

Description-en: Almighty Lightweight Fact Remote Exchange Daemon
 A.L.F.R.E.D. gathers status information in networks with dynamically
 chaing topologies, e.g. a Wifi mesh with mobile clients. It is a
 user space daemon for distributing arbitrary local information
 over the same mesh/network in a decentralized fashion. This data
 can be anything which appears to be useful - originally designed
 to replace the batman-adv visualization (vis), you may distribute
 hostnames, phone books, administration information, DNS information,
 the local weather forecast ...
 .
 Users may insert information by using the alfred binary on the command
 line, or use custom written programs to communicate with alfred directly
 through unix sockets. Once the local data is received, the alfred
 daemon takes care of distributing this information to other alfred
 servers on other nodes somewhere in the network. As addressing scheme
 IPv6 link-local multicast addresses are used which do not require any
 manual configuration. A user can request data from alfred, and will
 receive the information available from all alfred servers in the network.

Description-md5: 6852e874e3a0a408361775c4958b1233
Description-en: Logging library for java
 log4j is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of
 output targets.
 .
 It is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application
 binary. The log4j package is designed so that log statements can remain in
 shipped code without incurring a high performance cost.
 .
 One of the distinctive features of log4j is the notion of hierarchical
 loggers. Using loggers it is possible to selectively control which log
 statements are output at arbitrary granularity.
 .
 Log4j can output to: a file, a rolling file, a database with a JDBC driver,
 many output  asynchronously, a JMS Topic, a swing based logging console,
 the NT event log, /dev/null, a SMTP server (using javamail), a socket server,
 syslog, telnet daemon and stdout.
 .
 The format of the output can be defined using one of the various layout
 (or user defined layout) like: simple text, html, date, pattern defined and
 XML.

 The main principle is that a central machine hosts the proxy for a local
 network, and clients configure their APT setup to download through it.
 Apt-Cacher NG keeps a copy of all useful data that passes through it, and when
 a similar request is made, the cached copy of the data is delivered without
 being re-downloaded.
 .
 Apt-Cacher NG has been designed from scratch as a replacement for
 apt-cacher, but with a focus on maximizing throughput with low system
 resource requirements. It can also be used as replacement for apt-proxy and
 approx with no need to modify clients' sources.list files.

Description-md5: e39bd027177663ac42fd9d41d2b6154b
Description-en: rebuild a new abstract syntax tree from Python's AST
 The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
 Python source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse,
 pylint... Well, actually the development of this library is essentially
 governed by pylint's needs. It used to be called logilab-astng.
 .
 It provides a compatible representation which comes from the `_ast`
 module.  It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by
 recursively walking down the AST and building an extended ast. The new
 node classes have additional methods and attributes for different
 usages.  They include some support for static inference and local name
 scopes.  Furthermore, astroid builds partial trees by inspecting living
 objects.
 .
 Main modules are:
 .
   * `bases`, `node_classses` and `scoped_nodes` contain the classes for the
     different type of nodes of the tree.
 .
   * the `manager` contains a high level object to get astroid trees from
     source files and living objects. It maintains a cache of previously
     constructed tree for quick access.
 .
 python-astroid is the new name of former python-logilab-astng library.

 the official buildd build logs) to help maintainers detect missing
 hardening flags in their packages.

 This package contains the BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and
 control utility for the BOINC core client. It gives a detailed
 overview of the state of the client it is monitoring, as there are
  * attached projects
  * running tasks
  * file transfers between the client and project servers
  * statistics about granted credits and disk usage for every project
  * constraints on CPU usage
 The BOINC Manager has two modes of operation, the "Simple View" in which
 it only displays the most important information and the "Advanced View"
 in which all information and all control elements are available.

 projects.
 .
 The BOINC client is configurable by the command line or the BOINC
 manager's GUI to compute with any range between 0% and 100% of
 available resources, and to change that ratio to a higher after
 some user determined duration of inactivity. There is now quite
 a number of individuals who prefer to have everything presented
 with their accustomed principle for setting and choosing a screen
 saver. Upon inactivity, the BOINC client is started, and stopped
 again when the user is back. To save the screen, it then shows
 the graphical progress indication as optionally shown also by
 the manager.
 .
 This package is excellent to further promote BOINC, recalling the
 effect SETI@Home once had in the Cambridge, UK, CB2 Cybercafe.
 Just, when using it together with the regular BOINC client setup,
 it is suggested not to have all CPUs used to avoid multiple
 processes running on the same core.

 Please note that the server and the client should be on the same
 version of borgbackup. Using different versions of borgbackup on
 client and server might result in 'incompatible API version' error
 messages and a non-working backup.

 Project should be useful when you have to administer many computers
 distributed through different networks and connected via NAT. In most of
 cases you may just install miredo, gogoc or any other tunnel broker's
 software and these computers will be available via IPv6 addresses. BOSixNet
 includes the collection of tools for automatic updating the list of such
 hosts.

 This package provides the shell script which periodically sends information
 about current IPv6 address to remote server and updates local /etc/hosts
 based on data received from that remote server. It is expected that
 bosixnet-webui is launched on that remote server.

Description-en: e-book converter and library management
 Calibre is meant to be a complete e-library solution. It includes library
 management, format conversion, news feeds to e-book conversion as well as
 e-book reader sync features.
 .
 Calibre is primarily an e-book cataloging program. It manages your e-book
 collection for you. It is designed around the concept of the logical book,
 i.e. a single entry in the database that may correspond to e-books in several
 formats. It also supports conversion from a dozen different e-book formats to
 LRF and EPUB. A graphical interface to the conversion software can be
 accessed easily by just clicking the "Convert E-books" button.
 .
 Supported input formats are: MOBI, LIT, PRC, EPUB, ODT, HTML, CBR, CBZ, RTF,
 TXT, PDF and LRS.
 .
 Calibre has a modular device driver design that makes adding support for
 different e-reader devices easy. At the moment, it has support for the
 SONY PRS 500/505/700 and the iPhone (with the stanza reader software).
 Syncing supports updating metadata on the device from metadata in the library
 and the creation of collections on the device based on the tags defined in
 the library view. If an book has more than one format available, calibre
 automatically chooses the best format when uploading to the device.
 .
 Calibre can automatically fetch news from a number of websites/RSS feeds,
 format the news into a e-book and upload to a connected device. There is
 support for generating LRF/EPUB e-books. The e-books include the *full*
 versions of the articles, not just the summaries.
 .
 Calibre has also a built-in e-book viewer that can display all the major e-book
 formats.

Package: cgview
Description-md5: 43e679418d17db04183ad02e8a2c137e
Description-en: Circular Genome Viewer
 CGView is a Java package for generating high quality, zoomable maps of
 circular genomes. Its primary purpose is to serve as a component of
 sequence annotation pipelines, as a means of generating visual output
 suitable for the web. Feature information and rendering options are
 supplied to the program using an XML file, a tab delimited file, or an
 NCBI ptt file. CGView converts the input into a graphical map (PNG, JPG,
 or Scalable Vector Graphics format), complete with labels, a title,
 legends, and footnotes. In addition to the default full view map, the
 program can generate a series of hyperlinked maps showing expanded
 views. The linked maps can be explored using any web browser, allowing
 rapid genome browsing, and facilitating data sharing. The feature labels
 in maps can be hyperlinked to external resources, allowing CGView maps
 to be integrated with existing web site content or databases.
 .
 In addition to the CGView application, an API is available for
 generating maps from within other Java applications, using the
 cgview package.
 .
 CGView can be used for any of the following:
  * Bacterial genome visualization and browsing - CGView can be
    incorporated into bacterial genome annotation pipelines, as a means
    of generating web content for data visualization and navigation. The
    PNG and image map content does not require Java applets or special
    browser plugins.
  * Genome poster generation - CGView can generate poster-sized images of
    circular genomes in rasterized image formats or in Scalable Vector
    Graphics format.
  * Sequence analysis visualization - CGView can be used to display the
    output of sequence analysis programs in a circular context.
 .
 CGView features:
  * Images can be generated in PNG, JPG, or SVG format. See the
    CGView gallery.
  * Static or interactive maps can be generated. The interactive maps
    make use of standard PNG images and HTML image maps. Scalable Vector
    Graphics output is included in the interactive maps (see example).
  * The XML input allows complete control over the appearance of the map.
  * Tab delimited input files and NCBI ptt files can be used as an
    alternative to the XML format.
  * The CGView API can be used to incorporate CGView into Java
    applications.
  * The CGView applet can be used to incorporate zoomable maps into web
    pages (see example).
  * The CGView Server can be used to generate maps online.

Description-md5: 4cab05e1aaeb16dba768fed7b2d14922
Description-en: statistics collection and monitoring daemon
 collectd is a small daemon which collects system information periodically and
 provides mechanisms to monitor and store the values in a variety of ways.
 Since the daemon doesn't need to startup every time it wants to update the
 values it's very fast and easy on the system. Also, the statistics are very
 fine grained since the files are updated every 10 seconds by default.
 .
 The collected information can be used to find current performance bottlenecks
 (performance analysis) and predict future system load (capacity planning).
 .
 This package provides a full installation of the daemon, including the
 configuration. For the core system, see the "collectd-core" package, which
 allows sites to, e.g., provide customizations (like a custom default
 configuration) on top of it without having to modify the "collectd" package.

 including kdump, LKCD, netdump and diskdump.
 .
 o  The tool is loosely based on the SVR4 crash command, but has been
    completely integrated with gdb in order to be able to display
    formatted kernel data structures, disassemble source code, etc.
 .
 o  The current set of available commands consist of common kernel core
    analysis tools such as a context-specific stack traces, source code
    disassembly, kernel variable displays, memory display, dumps of
    linked-lists, etc.  In addition, any gdb command may be entered,
    which in turn will be passed onto the gdb module for execution.
 .
 o  There are several commands that delve deeper into specific kernel
    subsystems, which also serve as templates for kernel developers
    to create new commands for analysis of a specific area of interest.
    Adding a new command is a simple affair, and a quick recompile
    adds it to the command menu.
 .
 o  The intent is to make the tool independent of Linux version dependencies,
    building in recognition of major kernel code changes so as to adapt to
    new kernel versions, while maintaining backwards compatibility.

Package: darktable
Description-md5: 9bb162e0cc542877672e43a15da10cd8
Description-en: virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers
 Darktable manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view
 them  through a zoomable lighttable. it also enables you to develop raw
 images and enhance them.
 .
 It tries to fill the gap between the many excellent existing free
 raw converters and image management tools (such as ufraw or f-spot).
 The user interface is built around efficient caching of image metadata and
 mipmaps, all stored in a database. the user will always be able to interact,
 even if the full resolution image is not yet loaded.
 .
 All editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached image
 buffers for display. the full image is only converted during export. The
 frontend is written in gtk+/cairo, the database uses sqlite3, raw image
 loading is done using rawspeed, high-dynamic range, and standard image formats
 such as jpeg are also supported. The core operates completely on floating
 point values, so darktable can not only be used for photography but also for
 scientifically acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic range).

 Its secondary goal is to do so with the minimum removal of data and splitting
 of reads.

Package: dazzdb
Description-md5: 7e00727db0845d5aaf47b78dbb71d5bc
Description-en: manage nucleotide sequencing read data
 To facilitate the multiple phases of the dazzler assembler, all the read data
 is organized into what is effectively a database of the
 reads and their meta-information. The design goals for this data base
 are as follows:
  * The database stores the source Pacbio read information in such a
    way that it can re-create the original input data, thus permitting
    a user to remove the (effectively redundant) source files. This
    avoids duplicating the same data, once in the source file and once
    in the database.
  * The data base can be built up incrementally, that is new sequence
    data can be added to the data base over time.
  * The data base flexibly allows one to store any meta-data desired for
    reads. This is accomplished with the concept of *tracks* that
    implementors can add as they need them.
  * The data is held in a compressed form equivalent to the .dexta and
    .dexqv files of the data extraction module. Both the .fasta and
    .quiva information for each read is held in the data base and can be
    recreated from it. The .quiva information can be added separately and
    later on if desired.
  * To facilitate job parallel, cluster operation of the phases of the
    assembler, the database has a concept of a *current partitioning* in
    which all the reads that are over a given length and optionally
    unique to a well, are divided up into *blocks* containing roughly a
    given number of bases, except possibly the last block which may have
    a short count. Often programs can be run on blocks or pairs of blocks
    and each such job is reasonably well balanced as the blocks are all
    the same size. One must be careful about changing the partition
    during an assembly as doing so can void the structural validity of
    any interim block-based results.

 diskscan is intended to find sectors of a storage medium
 (hard disk, flash drive or pendrive, etc.) which are bad
 or in the process of going bad.
 .
 The operation is entirely read-only and does not cause
 damage to the data on filesystems. As the program reads
 block device sectors, it will work whether there is a
 filesystem or not.

 diskscan reads the entire block device and notes the time
 it took to read a block. When there is an error it is
 immediately noted and also when there is a higher latency
 to read a block. A histogram of the block latency times is
 also given to assess the health of the medium.

 diskscan can also be used to test the speed and quality of
 the medium. All sectors of a perfect medium could be read
 at the same speed.

 we can transition to the real rootfs.  This is all driven off of
 device availability.  Therefore, instead of scripts hard-coded to do
 various things, we depend on udev to create device nodes for us and
 then when we have the rootfs's device node, we mount and carry on.

 To make use of this program, you will need a document created
 by latex-beamer, and you will need two monitors connected to
 your computer.
 They do not need to have the same resolution, not even the same
 aspect ratio.
 .
 This program will split your PDF page in half, and display the
 left half (intended for the audience) on one monitor (think:
 a notebook's VGA output connected to your university's projector)
 and it will display the right half (intended for you) on the
 second screen.
 Also, on the second screen, you get page thumbnails and status
 information, like the time since you started the presentation
 and a "wall clock".

 Scans a sequence file for adapters, and, based on a log-scaled threshold,
 determines a set of clipping parameters and performs clipping. Also does
 skewing detection and quality filtering.
  * fastq-multx
 Demultiplexes a fastq. Capable of auto-determining barcode id's based on a
 master set fields. Keeps multiple reads in-sync during demultiplexing. Can
 verify that the reads are in-sync as well, and fail if they're not.
  * fastq-join
 Similar to audy's stitch program, but in C, more efficient and supports some
 automatic benchmarking and tuning. It uses the same "squared distance for
 anchored alignment" as other tools.
  * varcall

 WARNING: USE THIS MODULE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!
 This module allows ejabberd administrators to remotely execute shell commands
 which could compromise both the ejabberd server and the whole machine.
 .
 This module provides the ejabberd server administrator a method to remotely
 execute shell commands through the ejabberd server.
 .
 It provides a page in the ejabberd Web Admin which only the administrators of
 the whole server can access.
 .
 Three types of commands are possible:
  * ejabberd_ctl: makes a call to ejabberd_ctl;
  * erlang shell: executes an erlang command;
  * system shell: executes a command on the system shell.
 The result of the execution will be shown.
 .
 In the system shell, only non-interactive commands will work correctly,
 for example this will work:
  ps -all
 Don't use commands that start an interactive mode:
 DON'T TRY THIS: top
 DON'T TRY THIS: vim readme.txt
 .
 This module does not check if the commands are dangerous or problematic,
 so this module is only recommended for experienced ejabberd and Erlang/OTP
 administrators. USE THIS MODULE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!

Package: erlang-luerl
Description-md5: ba0442956c0172294ab501db8dfd5616
Description-en: implementation of Lua in Erlang
 An experimental implementation of Lua 5.2 written solely in pure Erlang
 .
 When to use Luerl:
 .
 Fast Language Switch: Luerl should allow you to switch between Erlang and Lua
 incredibly fast, introducing a way to use very small bits of logic programmed
 in Lua, inside an Erlang application, with good performance.
 .
 Multicore: Luerl provides a way to transparently utilize multicores. The
 underlying Erlang VM takes care of the distribution.
 .
 Microprocesses: It should give you a Lua environment that allows you to
 effortlessly run tens of thousands of Lua processes in parallel, leveraging
 the famed microprocesses implementation of the Erlang VM. The empty Luerl
 State footprint will be yet smaller than the C Lua State footprint.
 .
 Forking Up: Because of the immutable nature of the Luerl VM, it becomes a
 natural operation to use the same Lua State as a starting point for multiple
 parallel calculations.
 .
 However, Luerl will generally run slower than a reasonable native Lua
 implementation. This is mainly due the emulation of mutable data on top of an
 immutable world. There is really no way around this. An alternative would be
 to implement a special Lua memory outside of the normal Erlang, but this would
 defeat the purpose of Luerl. It would instead be then more logical to connect
 to a native Lua.
 .
 Some valid use cases for Luerl are:
  * Lua code will be run only occasionally and it wouldn't be worth managing
    an extra language implementation in the application;
  * the Lua code chunks are small so the slower speed is weighed up by Luerl's
    faster interface;
  * the Lua code calculates and reads variables more than changing them;
  * the same Lua State is repeatedly used to 'fork up' as a basis for
    massively many parallel calculations, based on the same state;
  * it is easy to run multiple instances of Luerl which could better utilise
    multicores.

Description-md5: 92de131cd4b319687b7cc386f50bb894
Description-en: maximum likelihood ancestral amino-acid sequence reconstruction
 FastML is a bioinformatics tool for the reconstruction of ancestral
 sequences based on the phylogenetic relations between homologous
 sequences. FastML runs several algorithms that reconstruct the ancestral
 sequences with emphasis on an accurate reconstruction of both indels and
 characters. For character reconstruction the previously described FastML
 algorithms are used to efficiently infer the most likely ancestral
 sequences for each internal node of the tree. Both joint and the
 marginal reconstructions are provided. For indels reconstruction the
 sequences are first coded according to the indel events detected within
 the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and then a state-of-the-art
 likelihood model is used to reconstruct ancestral indels states. The
 results are the most probable sequences, together with posterior
 probabilities for each character and indel at each sequence position for
 each internal node of the tree. FastML is generic and is applicable for
 any type of molecular sequences (nucleotide, protein, or codon
 sequences).

Description-en: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - development files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").

Package: flatpak
Description-md5: f91acb1d2880527b2759bc5e2d99fbff
Description-en: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.
 .
 This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
 launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
 limited access to resources outside the sandbox.

 The filecompare command is used to create a special and auxiliary input
 file for colorize. The colorize command will generate an intuitive graphic
 that will make easier to perceive the level of changes between the files.

Description-en: miscellanous plugins for Geany
 This plugin adds various small addons to Geany which aren't worth an
 individual plugin, but might still be useful for people.
  * DocList: This addon places a new item in the toolbar and when clicked
    offers a menu listing all open files plus the 'Close All' and 'Close Other
    Documents' menu items. This can be useful to quickly access open files and
    switch to them.
  * OpenURI: Adds 'Open URI' and 'Copy URI' menu items to the editor menu when
    the word under the cursor looks like a URI. 'Open URI' uses the browser
    command configured in Geany to open it.
  * Tasks: The tasks plugin goes through a file being edited and picks out
    lines with "TODO" or "FIXME" in them. It collects the text after those words
    and puts them in a new "Tasks" tab in the message window. Clicking on a task
    in that tab takes you to the line in the file where the task was defined.
  * Systray: Adds a status icon to the notification area (systray) and
    provides a simple popup menu with some basic actions. It can also be used
    to quickly show and hide the Geany main window.

 .
 Features:
  * auto-close for: { }, [ ], ( ), " ", ' ', < >, ` `
  * customizeable auto-closing inside strings and comments
  * delete pairing character if you pressed BackSpace
  * suppress inserting one char twice (if you type "{}" you will get "{}", not
    "{}}")
  * enclose selected text into brackets instead of removing selection (select
    text and type "(" or ")" to enclose selection into "()")
  * keep selection when enclosing
  * for C-like languages enclosing selection into "{}" makes auto-indentation
    (select text and type "{" or "}" - text will be enclosed and indented)
  * enclosing in {} moves cursor to beginning (before "{" character)
  * for C-like languages to insert {}-block you do not need to select text
    precisely: plugin detects boundaries automatically, just ensure that
    selection covers lines you need to indent (works like TAB indentation)
  * fix auto-indent inside {} (makes full indent for this block)
  * auto-close curly bracket by pressing Enter
  * auto-close functions (``"sin(|" -> "sin(|);"``) with doubling suppression
    (for C/C++ languages only)
  * remove paring brace when pressing Shift+BackSpace, unindent {}-blocks
  * add semicolon after ``struct {|};`` and ``class {|};``
  * move cursor to closed char by pressing Tab

 GeanyCtags adds a simple support for generating and querying ctags files
 for a Geany project.
 .
 Even though Geany supports symbol definition searching by itself within the
 open files (and with a plugin support within the whole project), tag
 regeneration can become too slow for really big projects. This is why this
 plugin was created. It makes it possible to generate the tag file only once
 and just query it when searching for a particular symbol
 definition/declaration. This approach is fine for big projects where most
 of the codebase remains unchanged and the tag positions remain more or
 less static.

Description-md5: 3c5407a2585def5c608431ca97172a4b
Description-en: Documentation tool for annotated Haskell source code
 Haddock is a tool for automatically generating documentation from
 annotated Haskell source code.  It is primary intended for documenting
 libraries, but it should be useful for any kind of Haskell code.
 .
 Haddock lets you write documentation annotations next to the
 definitions of functions and types in the source code, in a syntax
 that is easy on the eye when writing the source code (no heavyweight
 mark-up).  The documentation generated by Haddock is fully hyperlinked:
 click on a type name in a type signature to go straight to the
 definition, and documentation, for that type.
 .
 Haddock can generate documentation in multiple formats; currently HTML
 is implemented, and there is partial support for generating DocBook.
 .
 This package contains Haddock version 2.10.0.

Package: git-annex
Description-md5: ed39e4e4c2d1afd0f4612868aabeeec0
Description-en: manage files with git, without checking their contents into git
 git-annex allows managing files with git, without checking the file
 contents into git. While that may seem paradoxical, it is useful when
 dealing with files larger than git can currently easily handle, whether due
 to limitations in memory, time, or disk space.
 .
 It can store large files in many places, from local hard drives, to a
 large number of cloud storage services, including S3, WebDAV,
 and rsync, with a dozen cloud storage providers usable via plugins.
 Files can be stored encrypted with gpg, so that the cloud storage
 provider cannot see your data. git-annex keeps track of where each file
 is stored, so it knows how many copies are available, and has many
 facilities to ensure your data is preserved.
 .
 git-annex can also be used to keep a folder in sync between computers,
 noticing when files are changed, and automatically committing them
 to git and transferring them to other computers. The git-annex webapp
 makes it easy to set up and use git-annex this way.

Description-md5: 7ddcd2ec394dcefbac5267b9552f12c3
Description-en: GNU Radio Software Radio Toolkit
 GNU Radio provides signal processing blocks to implement software
 radios. It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF
 hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a
 simulation-like environment. It is widely used in hobbyist, academic
 and commercial environments to support both wireless communications
 research and real-world radio systems.
 .
 GNU Radio applications are primarily written using the Python
 programming language, while the supplied performance-critical signal
 processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point
 extensions, where available. Thus, the developer is able to implement
 real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use,
 rapid-application-development environment.
 .
 While not primarily a simulation tool, GNU Radio does support
 development of signal processing algorithms using pre-recorded or
 generated data, avoiding the need for actual RF hardware.

 .
    - Helpful error reporting to aid on figuring problems out
    - Richer test helpers: assertions which interrupt the test immediately,
      deep multi-type comparisons, string matching, etc
    - Suite-based grouping of tests

    - Benchmarks integrated in the suite logic (with fixtures, etc)
    - Management of temporary directories
    - Panic-catching logic, with proper error reporting
    - Proper counting of successes, failures, panics, missed tests, skips, etc
    - Explicit test skipping
    - Support for expected failures
    - Verbosity flag which disables output caching (helpful to debug hanging
      tests, for instance)
    - Multi-line string reporting for more comprehensible failures
    - Inclusion of comments surrounding checks on failure reports

Description-md5: 606237586cd533eed7972349938eab1e
Description-en: HTTP request pipeline suitable for use across multiple go-routines
 Package autorest implements an HTTP request pipeline suitable for use across
 multiple go-routines and provides the shared routines relied on by AutoRest
 (see https://github.com/Azure/autorest/) generated Go code.
 .
 The package breaks sending and responding to HTTP requests into three phases:
 Preparing, Sending, and Responding.
 .
 Each phase relies on decorators to modify and / or manage processing.
 Decorators may first modify and then pass the data along, pass the data first
 and then modify the result, or wrap themselves around passing the data (such as
 a logger might do). Decorators run in the order provided.
 .
 Preparers and Responders may be shared and re-used (assuming the underlying
 decorators support sharing and re-use). Performant use is obtained by creating
 one or more Preparers and Responders shared among multiple go-routines, and a
 single Sender shared among multiple sending go-routines, all bound together by
 means of input / output channels.
 .
 Decorators hold their passed state within a closure (such as the path
 components in the example above). Be careful to share Preparers and Responders
 only in a context where such held state applies. For example, it may not make
 sense to share a Preparer that applies a query string from a fixed set of
 values. Similarly, sharing a Responder that reads the response body into a
 passed struct (e.g., ByUnmarshallingJson) is likely incorrect.
 .
 Lastly, the Swagger specification (https://swagger.io) that drives AutoRest
 (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/) precisely defines two date forms: date and
 date-time. The github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/date package provides
 time.Time derivations to ensure correct parsing and formatting.
 .
 Errors raised by autorest objects and methods will conform to the
 autorest.Error interface.

Package: golang-github-golang-snappy-dev
Description-md5: 39893f9c93e59f79efba9fb8ee2e448b
Description-en: Implementation of the Snappy compression format in Go
 Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for maximum
 compression, or compatibility with any other compression library; instead, it
 aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. For instance, compared
 to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy is an order of magnitude faster for most
 inputs, but the resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100%
 bigger. On a single core of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy
 compresses at about 250 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 500 MB/sec or
 more.
 .
 This is an implementation of the Snappy compression format in the Go
 programming language.

Package: golang-github-gorilla-mux-dev
Description-md5: d61faf184d480e712a34f9f9497bde59
Description-en: powerful URL router and dispatcher for golang
 Package gorilla/mux implements a request router and dispatcher.
 .
 The name mux stands for "HTTP request multiplexer". Like the standard
 http.ServeMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests against a list of
 registered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL
 or other conditions. The main features are:
 .
  * Requests can be matched based on URL host, path, path prefix, schemes,
    header and query values, HTTP methods or using custom matchers.
  * URL hosts and paths can have variables with an optional regular expression.
  * Registered URLs can be built, or "reversed", which helps maintaining
    references to resources.
  * Routes can be used as subrouters: nested routes are only tested if the
    parent route matches. This is useful to define groups of routes that share
    common conditions like a host, a path prefix or other repeated attributes.
    As a bonus, this optimizes request matching.
  * It implements the http.Handler interface so it is compatible with the
    standard http.ServeMux.

Package: golang-github-hashicorp-errwrap-dev
Description-md5: 8f9ccf8319716d5c9b3fe6b07ffaa505
Description-en: Errwrap is a Go (golang) library for wrapping and querying errors
 errwrap is a package for Go that formalizes the pattern of wrapping errors and
 checking if an error contains another error.
 .
 There is a common pattern in Go of taking a returned error value and then
 wrapping it (such as with fmt.Errorf) before returning it. The problem with
 this pattern is that you completely lose the original error structure.
 .
 Arguably the correct approach is that you should make a custom structure
 implementing the error interface, and have the original error as a field on
 that structure, such as this example. This is a good approach, but you have to
 know the entire chain of possible rewrapping that happens, when you might just
 care about one.
 .
 errwrap formalizes this pattern (it doesn't matter what approach you use above)
 by giving a single interface for wrapping errors, checking if a specific error
 is wrapped, and extracting that error.

Package: golang-github-hashicorp-go-cleanhttp-dev
Description-md5: 666b58b21d02ffa210360802acbe29c5
Description-en: Functions for accessing "clean" Go http.Client values
 The Go standard library contains a default http.Client called
 http.DefaultClient. It is a common idiom in Go code to start with
 http.DefaultClient and tweak it as necessary, and in fact, this is encouraged;
 from the http package documentation:
 .
   The Client's Transport typically has internal state (cached TCP connections),
   so Clients should be reused instead of created as needed. Clients are safe
   for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.
 .
 Unfortunately, this is a shared value, and it is not uncommon for libraries to
 assume that they are free to modify it at will. With enough dependencies, it
 can be very easy to encounter strange problems and race conditions due to
 manipulation of this shared value across libraries and goroutines (clients are
 safe for concurrent use, but writing values to the client struct itself is not
 protected).
 .
 Making things worse is the fact that a bare http.Client will use a default
 http.Transport called http.DefaultTransport, which is another global value that
 behaves the same way. So it is not simply enough to replace http.DefaultClient
 with &http.Client{}.
 .
 This repository provides some simple functions to get a "clean" http.Client --
 one that uses the same default values as the Go standard library, but returns a
 client that does not share any state with other clients.
 .

Description-en: Go package for representing a list of errors as a single error
 go-multierror is a package for Go that provides a mechanism for representing a
 list of error values as a single error.
 .
 This allows a function in Go to return an error that might actually be a list
 of errors. If the caller knows this, they can unwrap the list and access the
 errors. If the caller doesn't know, the error formats to a nice human-readable
 format.

 library, as well.

Description-en: Golang package for gossip based membership and failure detection
 memberlist is a Go library that manages cluster membership and member failure
 detection using a gossip based protocol.
 .
 The use cases for such a library are far-reaching: all distributed systems
 require membership, and memberlist is a re-usable solution to managing cluster
 membership and node failure detection.
 .
 memberlist is eventually consistent but converges quickly on average. The speed
 at which it converges can be heavily tuned via various knobs on the protocol.
 Node failures are detected and network partitions are partially tolerated by
 attempting to communicate to potentially dead nodes through multiple routes.

Description-md5: 795ba6f76c1759ba503b27c28cac9396
Description-en: library for decoding generic map values into native Go structures
 mapstructure is a Go library for decoding generic map values to structures and
 vice versa, while providing helpful error handling.
 .
 This library is most useful when decoding values from some data stream (JSON,
 Gob, etc.) where you don't quite know the structure of the underlying data
 until you read a part of it. You can therefore read a map[string]interface{}
 and use this library to decode it into the proper underlying native Go
 structure.
 .
 Go offers fantastic standard libraries for decoding formats such as JSON. The
 standard method is to have a struct pre-created, and populate that struct from
 the bytes of the encoded format. This is great, but the problem is if you have
 configuration or an encoding that changes slightly depending on specific
 fields.
 .
 Perhaps we can't populate a specific structure without first reading the "type"
 field from the JSON. We could always do two passes over the decoding of the
 JSON (reading the "type" first, and the rest later). However, it is much
 simpler to just decode this into a map[string]interface{} structure, read the
 "type" key, then use something like this library to decode it into the proper
 structure.

Description-en: counters and logarithmically bucketed histograms for distributed systems
 A metric system for high performance counters and histograms. Unlike
 popular metric systems today, this does not destroy the accuracy of
 histograms by sampling. Instead, a logarithmic bucketing function
 compresses values, generally within 1% of their true value (although
 between 0 and 1 the precision loss may not be within this boundary). This
 allows for extreme compression, which allows us to calculate arbitrarily
 high percentiles with no loss of accuracy - just a small amount of
 precision.  This is particularly useful for highly-clustered events that
 are tolerant of a small precision loss, but for which you REALLY care
 about what the tail looks like, such as measuring latency across a
 distributed system.

Description-md5: b4b4d9871f70004e38b95d07b2a2e0a0

 Package resumable registers resumable versions of hash functions. Resumable
 varieties of hash functions are available via the standard crypto package.
 Support can be checked by type assertion against the resumable.Hash interface.
 .
 While one can use these sub-packages directly, it makes more sense to register
 them using side-effect imports:
 .
   import _ "github.com/stevvooe/resumable/sha256"
 .
 This will make the resumable hashes available to the application through the
 standard crypto package. For example, if a new sha256 is required, one should
 use the following:
 .
   h := crypto.SHA256.New()
 .
 Such a features allows one to control the inclusion of resumable hash support
 in a single file. Applications that require the resumable hash implementation
 can type switch to detect support, while other parts of the application can be
 completely oblivious to the presence of the alternative hash functions.
 .
 Also note that the implementations available in this package are completely
 untouched from their Go counterparts in the standard library. Only an extra
 file is added to each package to implement the extra resumable hash functions.

Description-md5: e741e5c19ca97610b33cb146b0897b54
Description-en: go library to build distributed systems
 Mesh implements a gossip protocol that provide membership, unicast, and
 broadcast functionality with eventually-consistent semantics. In CAP terms, it
 is AP: highly-available and partition-tolerant.
 .
 Mesh works in a wide variety of network setups, including thru NAT and
 firewalls, and across clouds and datacenters. It works in situations where
 there is only partial connectivity, i.e. data is transparently routed across
 multiple hops when there is no direct connection between peers. It copes with
 partitions and partial network failure. It can be easily bootstrapped,
 typically only requiring knowledge of a single existing peer in the mesh to
 join. It has built-in shared-secret authentication and encryption. It scales
 to on the order of 100 peers, and has no dependencies.

Package: golang-gopkg-yaml.v2-dev
Description-md5: 6e824756f0591b8ea6b6af832141a3c8
Description-en: YAML support for the Go language
 The yaml package enables Go programs to very comfortably encode and
 decode YAML values. It was developed within Canonical as part of the
 juju project, and is based on a pure Go port of the well-known libyaml
 C library to parse and generate YAML data quickly and reliably.
 .
 The yaml package supports most of YAML 1.1 and 1.2, including support for
 anchors, tags, map merging, etc. Multi-document unmarshalling is not yet
 implemented, and base-60 floats from YAML 1.1 are purposefully not supported
 since they're a poor design and are gone in YAML 1.2.
 .
 This package is an incompatible successor to golang-goyaml
 ("gonuts.org/v1/yaml", and then renamed to "gopkg.in/yaml.v1").

Package: gosu
Description-md5: 72c0b42347139534207936c653f27fc4
Description-en: Simple Go-based setuid+setgid+setgroups+exec
 This is a simple tool grown out of the simple fact that "su" and "sudo" have
 very strange and often annoying TTY and signal-forwarding behavior. They're
 also somewhat complex to setup and use (especially in the case of "sudo"),
 which allows for a great deal of expressivity, but falls flat if all you need
 is "run this specific application as this specific user and get out of the
 pipeline".
 .
 The core of how "gosu" works is stolen directly from how Docker/libcontainer
 itself starts an application inside a container (and in fact, is using the
 "/etc/passwd" processing code directly from libcontainer's codebase).
 .
 Once the user/group is processed, we switch to that user, then we "exec" the
 specified process and "gosu" itself is no longer resident or involved in the
 process lifecycle at all. This avoids all the issues of signal passing and TTY,
 and punts them to the process invoking "gosu" and the process being invoked by
 "gosu", where they belong.

Package: gpart
Description-md5: c67d1023d87643ee01013d8070a0a8de
Description-en: Guess PC disk partition table, find lost partitions
 Gpart is a tool which tries to guess the primary partition table of a PC-type
 disk in case the primary partition table in sector 0 is damaged, incorrect or
 deleted.
 .
 It is also good at finding and listing the types, locations, and sizes of
 inadvertently-deleted partitions, both primary and logical. It gives you the
 information you need to manually re-create them (using fdisk, cfdisk, sfdisk,
 etc.).
 .
 The guessed table can also be written to a file or (if you firmly believe the
 guessed table is entirely correct) directly to a disk device.
 .
 Currently supported (guessable) filesystem or partition types:
 .
  * BeOS filesystem type.
  * FreeBSD/NetBSD/386BSD disklabel sub-partitioning scheme used on Intel
    platforms.
  * Linux second extended filesystem.
  * MS-DOS FAT12/16/32 "filesystems".
  * IBM OS/2 High Performance filesystem.
  * Linux LVM physical volumes (LVM by Heinz Mauelshagen).
  * Linux swap partitions (versions 0 and 1).
  * The Minix operating system filesystem type.
  * MS Windows NT/2000 filesystem.
  * QNX 4.x filesystem.
  * The Reiser filesystem (version 3.5.X, X > 11).
  * Sun Solaris on Intel platforms uses a sub-partitioning scheme on PC hard
    disks similar to the BSD disklabels.
  * Silicon Graphics' journalling filesystem for Linux.
 .
 Gpart is useful in recovery actions and forensics investigations.

Package: gpsprune
Description-md5: 4cd2b69a33c05e4615249da27b877da9
Description-en: visualize, edit, convert and prune GPS data
 GpsPrune is an application for viewing, editing and converting coordinate
 data from GPS systems. It's a tool for preparing GPS data before you go on a
 trip, and for playing with your collected GPS data after you get home again.
 .
 It can load data from arbitrary text-based formats (for example, any
 tab-separated or comma-separated file) or XML, or directly from a GPS
 receiver. It can display the data (as map view using OpenStreetMap
 images and as altitude profile), edit this data (for example delete
 points and ranges, sort waypoints, compress tracks), and save the data
 (in various text-based formats). It can also export data as a GPX
 file, or as KML/KMZ for import into Google Earth, or send it to a GPS
 receiver.
 .
 Some example uses of GpsPrune include cleaning up tracks by deleting
 wayward points - either recorded by error or by unintended detours. It
 can also be used to compare and combine tracks, convert to and from
 various formats, compress tracks, export data to Google Earth, or to
 analyse data to calculate distances, altitudes and so on.
 .
 Furthermore, GpsPrune is able to display the tracks in 3d format and
 lets you spin the model round to look at it from various directions.
 You can also export the model in POV format so that you can render a
 nice picture using Povray. You can also create charts of altitudes or
 speeds. It can also load Jpegs and read their coordinates from the
 EXIF tags, and export thumbnails of these photos to Kmz format so that
 they appear as popups in Google Earth. If your photos don't have
 coordinates yet, GpsPrune can be used to connect them (either manually or
 automatically using the photo timestamps) to data points, and write
 these coordinates into the EXIF tags.

 The general idea is to suppress symmetrical images caused by IQ
 imbalance in the RX path of quadrature receivers.
 It's composed of two subblocks:
 .
 "IQ Bal Fix": This applies the actual correction. to a complex
 stream. The correction parameters are only magnitude/phase and the
 actual correction algo is the same as applied in hardware in the USRP.
 You can either specify the correction parameters manually on the
 block, or send them via 'messages'.
 .
 "IQ Bal Optimize": This blocks tries to blindly detect the imbalance
 by minimizing the correlation between the left and right part of the
 spectrum. See the code for the "how it does it". The general idea is
 inspired from papers found on the internet and the way some SDR
 software achieve the same things (sdr# for eg, although there are
 significant differences in the actual implementation).

Package: hedgewars
Description-md5: 9c3ca8edc97a53189e3cb27b4118a5ca
Description-en: Funny turn-based artillery game, featuring fighting Hedgehogs!
 Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the
 course of the game, players take turns with one of their
 hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are
 available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby
 winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a
 variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by
 using particular tools such as the "Rope" or "Parachute", to
 move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited
 to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive
 thinking or moving.
 .
 A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players
 during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Homing Bee,
 Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine,
 Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause
 explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks.
 The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a
 restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when
 it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or
 through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either
 side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from
 contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the
 attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU turn is
 shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).

   - The messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are
     checkable by a third party.  Anyone can forge messages after a
     conversation to make them look like they came from you.  However,
     _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages
     they see are authentic and unmodified.

    that are checkable by a third party. Anyone can forge messages after
    a conversation to make them look like they came from you. However,
    _during_ a conversation, correspondents are assured the messages
    they see are authentic and unmodified.
  * Forward secrecy - if you lose control of your private keys,
    no previous conversation is compromised.

 Java API Compliance Checker (Java ACC) is a tool for checking backward binary
 and source-level compatibility of a Java library API. The tool checks classes
 declarations of old and new versions and analyzes changes that may break
 compatibility: removed methods, removed class fields, added abstract methods,
 etc. Binary incompatibility may result in crashing or incorrect behavior of
 existing clients built with an old version of a library when they are running
 with a new one. Source incompatibility may result in recompilation errors with
 a new library version. The tool is intended for library developers and
 operating system maintainers who are interested in ensuring backward

Package: jdupes
Description-md5: 8dce3c664dd3e550f5cdc39b88707cc5
Description-en: identify and delete duplicate files
 jdupes is a program based in fdupes. The main goal of jdupes is identify
 and taking actions upon duplicate files. In comparison with fdupes, jdupes
 is heavily modified from and improved.
 .
 The biggest reason to use jdupes is raw speed. In testing on various data
 sets, jdupes is over 7 times faster than fdupes-1.51 on average.
 .
 Code in jdupes is written with data loss avoidance as the highest priority.
 If a choice must be made between being aggressive or careful, the careful
 way is always chosen.
 .
 jdupes includes features that are not found in fdupes. Examples of such
 features include btrfs block-level deduplication and control over which
 file is kept when a match set is automatically deleted. jdupes is not
 afraid of dropping features of low value; a prime example is the -1 switch
 which outputs all matches in a set on one line, a feature which was found
 to be useless in real-world tests and therefore thrown out.
 .
 jdupes can convert duplicate files in hardlinks or relative softlinks. It
 is useful in several scenarios, as in Debian packaging, to create relative
 symlinks to lots of duplicate files.

Package: jedit
Description-md5: eb137161fe733c50e24507a41acb14ce
Description-en: Plugin-based editor for programmers
 As one of the most feature rich editors available, jEdit boasts support for
 syntax highlighting in more than 140 languages. jEdit combines the power of
 Emacs, the user-friendliness of Kate, and the advanced editing features
 (such as vertical paste) of Ultraedit, to bring you an open-source
 plugin-based programmer's editor of professional quality.
 .
 It is possible to define complex macros in BeanShell or Jython, or other
 languages that fit into the BSF. jEdit offers a powerful and user-friendly
 keyboard mapping system (including 2-keystroke shortcuts), making it
 possible to give jEdit a very Emacs-like feel, if you so desire.
 .
 Its functionality is easily extended by the use of 'plugins' which can be
 downloaded, updated, and installed, all without exiting the editor. These
 include a built-in Console shell integration, which lets you execute
 interactive external commands inside your editor, as well as bind them to
 keyboard shortcuts. The FTP plugin lets you browse and edit files on remote
 systems over FTP or SFTP. Other plugins provide shells, object oriented
 structure/code browsers, or completion popups for Java, XML, HTML, Ant,
 LaTeX, Python, Ruby, Perl, C, C++, bash, Scheme, Prolog, and many other
 languages.

  - Similar behavior cross all supported platforms.
  - Flexibility, don't create unnecessary restrictions preventing ad-hoc
    solutions.
  - Makefile can very simple to write and maintain.
 .
 There are four concepts being tried out in the current kBuild incaration:
  - One configuration file for a subtree automatically included.
  - Target configuration templates as the primary mechanism for makefile
    simplification.
  - Tools and SDKs for helping out the templates with flexibility.
  - Non-recursive makefile method by using sub-makefiles.
 .
 kBuild does not provide any facilities for checking compiler/library/header
 configurations, that's not in its scope. If this is important for your
 project, check out the autoconf tool in the GNU build system. It is possible
 to use kBuild together with autoconf if you like, but you might just as well
 use the full GNU package.

Package: atac
Description-md5: 7c0df19216e3aa53e4831aab9fc46b7e
Description-en: genome assembly-to-assembly comparison
 atac computes a one-to-one pairwise alignment of large DNA sequences. It first
 finds the unique k-mers in each sequence, chains them to larger blocks, and
 fills in spaces between blocks. It was written primarily to transfer
 annotations between different assemblies of the human genome.
 .
 The output is a set of ungapped 'matches', and a set of gapped 'runs' formed
 from the matches. Each match or run associates one sequence with the other
 sequence. The association is 'unique', in that there is no other (sizeable)
 associations for either sequence. Thus, large repeats and duplications are not
 present in the output - they appear as unmapped regions.
 .
 Though the output is always pairwise, atac can cache intermediate results to
 speed a comparisons of multiple sequences.

Package: sim4db
Description-md5: 85f8fe3bbe88f71c2e69cb9b24788d42
Description-en: batch spliced alignment of cDNA sequences to a target genome
 Sim4db performs fast batch alignment of large cDNA (EST, mRNA) sequence
 sets to a set of eukaryotic genomic regions. It uses the sim4 and sim4cc
 algorithms to determine the alignments, but incorporates a fast sequence
 indexing and retrieval mechanism, implemented in the sister package
 'leaff', to speedily process large volumes of sequences.
 .
 While sim4db produces alignments in the same way as sim4 or sim4cc, it
 has additional features to make it more amenable for use with whole-genome
 annotation pipelines. A script file can be used to group pairings between
 cDNAs and their corresponding genomic regions, to be aligned as one run
 and using the same set of parameters. Sim4db also optionally reports more
 than one alignment for the same cDNA within a genomic region, as long
 as they meet user-defined criteria such as minimum length, percentage
 sequence identity or coverage. This feature is instrumental in finding
 all alignments of a gene family at one locus. Lastly, the output is
 presented either as custom sim4db alignments or as GFF3 gene features.
 .

Package: kraken
Description-md5: 4dc49da345dc88dcd656d9a30393ce7e
Description-en: assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA sequences
 Kraken is a system for assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA
 sequences, usually obtained through metagenomic studies. Previous
 attempts by other bioinformatics software to accomplish this task have
 often used sequence alignment or machine learning techniques that were
 quite slow, leading to the development of less sensitive but much faster
 abundance estimation programs. Kraken aims to achieve high sensitivity
 and high speed by utilizing exact alignments of k-mers and a novel
 classification algorithm.
 .
 In its fastest mode of operation, for a simulated metagenome of 100 bp
 reads, Kraken processed over 4 million reads per minute on a single
 core, over 900 times faster than Megablast and over 11 times faster than
 the abundance estimation program MetaPhlAn. Kraken's accuracy is
 comparable with Megablast, with slightly lower sensitivity and very high
 precision.

 A lazy object proxy is an object that wraps a callable but defers the call
 until the object is actually required, and caches the result of said call.
 .
 These kinds of objects are useful in resolving various dependency issues, few
 examples:
 .
  * Objects that need to held circular references at each other, but at
    different stages. To instantiate object Foo you need an instance of Bar.
    Instance of Bar needs an instance of Foo in some of it methods (but not at
    construction).  Circular imports sound familiar?
 .
  * Performance sensitive code. You don't know ahead of time what you're going
    to use but you don't want to pay for allocating all the resources at the
    start as you usually need just few of them.

Description-en: fast key-value storage library
 LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that
 provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values.
 .
 Features:
  * Keys and values are arbitrary byte arrays.
  * Data is stored sorted by key.
  * Callers can provide a custom comparison function to override
    the sort order.
  * The basic operations are Put(key,value), Get(key), Delete(key).
  * Multiple changes can be made in one atomic batch.
  * Users can create a transient snapshot to get a consistent view of
    data.
  * Forward and backward iteration is supported over the data.
  * Data is automatically compressed using the Snappy compression
    library.
  * External activity (file system operations etc.) is relayed through
    a virtual interface so users can customize the operating system
    interactions.
  * Detailed documentation about how to use the library is included with
    the source code.
 .
 Limitations:
  * This is not a SQL database. It does not have a relational data model,
    it does not support SQL queries, and it has no support for indexes.
  * Only a single process (possibly multi-threaded) can access a
    particular database at a time.
  * There is no client-server support builtin to the library.
    An application that needs such support will have to wrap their own
    server around the library.

Package: libcrcutil-dev
Description-md5: 7cbb589eb48b2c03698723b050d7e04d
Description-en: library for cyclic redundancy check (CRC) computation - development files
 Crcutil library provides efficient implementation of CRC algorithms. It
 includes reference implementation of a novel Multiword CRC algorithm
 invented by Andrew Kadatch and Bob Jenkins in early 2007. The new
 algorithm is heavily tuned towards modern Intel and AMD processors and is
 substantially faster than almost all other software CRC algorithms.
 .
 Included whitepaper describes the details of Multiword CRC algorithm as
 well as other algorithms and CRC manipulation routines implemented by
 crcutil library.
 .
 Crcutil library computes:
  * Hardware-assisted CRC32C: 0.13 (Nehalem) CPU cycles per byte.
  * 64-bit and smaller CRCs: 1.0 (Nehalem) - 1.2 (Core) CPU cycles per byte.
  * 128-bit CRCs: 1.7 CPU cycles per byte.
 .
 Since computational speed of 64-bit CRCs is identical to 32-bit and
 16-bit, the use of crcutil library enables widespread use of more reliable

Description-md5: cc71c2c424596597f250c5939920e145
Description-en: library for cyclic redundancy check (CRC) computation - documentation
 Crcutil library provides efficient implementation of CRC algorithms. It
 includes reference implementation of a novel Multiword CRC algorithm
 invented by Andrew Kadatch and Bob Jenkins in early 2007. The new
 algorithm is heavily tuned towards modern Intel and AMD processors and is
 substantially faster than almost all other software CRC algorithms.
 .
 Included whitepaper describes the details of Multiword CRC algorithm as
 well as other algorithms and CRC manipulation routines implemented by
 crcutil library.
 .
 Crcutil library computes:
  * Hardware-assisted CRC32C: 0.13 (Nehalem) CPU cycles per byte.
  * 64-bit and smaller CRCs: 1.0 (Nehalem) - 1.2 (Core) CPU cycles per byte.
  * 128-bit CRCs: 1.7 CPU cycles per byte.
 .
 Since computational speed of 64-bit CRCs is identical to 32-bit and
 16-bit, the use of crcutil library enables widespread use of more reliable
 64-bit CRCs instead of 32-bit ones.
 .
 As a bonus, crcutil also implements a number of useful CRC "tricks" (e.g.
 computation of CRC of concatenated blocks of data of known length and CRC

Description-en: Perl simple interface to GTK+ 3's complex MVC list widget
 Gtk3 has a powerful, but complex MVC (Model, View, Controller) system used to
 implement list and tree widgets. Gtk3::SimpleList automates the complex setup
 work and allows you to treat the list model as a more natural list of lists
 structure.
 .
 After creating a new Gtk3::SimpleList object with the desired columns you may
 set the list data with a simple Perl array assignment. Rows may be added or
 deleted with all of the normal array operations. You can treat the data
 member of the list simplelist object as an array reference, and manipulate
 the list data with perl's normal array operators.
 .
 A mechanism has also been put into place allowing columns to be Perl scalars.
 The scalar is converted to text through Perl's normal mechanisms and then
 displayed in the list. This same mechanism can be expanded by defining
 arbitrary new column types before calling the new function.

 the heart of most Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetics packages. It
 can make use of highly-parallel processors such as those in graphics cards
 (GPUs) found in many PCs.
 .
 The project involves an open API and fast implementations of a library for
 evaluating phylogenetic likelihoods (continuous time Markov processes) of
 biomolecular sequence evolution.
 .
 The aim is to provide high performance evaluation 'services' to a wide range
 of phylogenetic software, both Bayesian samplers and Maximum Likelihood
 optimizers.  This allows these packages to make use of implementations that
 make use of optimized hardware such as graphics processing units.
 .
 This package contains development files needed to build against Beagle library.

Package: libhtml-formattext-withlinks-andtables-perl
Description-md5: 719344e248e3039bcd26dcae58cf2a54
Description-en: Perl module to converts HTML to Text with tables intact
 HTML::FormatText::WithLinks::AndTables was inspired by
 HTML::FormatText::WithLinks which has proven to be a useful `lynx -dump`
 work-alike.
 .
 This module can in a rudimentary sense do so. The aim was to provide
 facility to take a simple HTML based email template, and to also convert
 it to text with the <TABLE> structure intact for inclusion as
 "multipart/alternative" content.
 .
 Further, it will preserve both the formatting specified by the <TD> tag's
 "align" attribute, and will also preserve multiline text inside of a <TD>
 element provided it is broken using <BR/> tags.

Package: libhtml-truncate-perl
Description-md5: ad40e6ded5e98109dd82e2134d083819
Description-en: Perl module to truncate HTML by percentage or character count
 When working with text it is common to want to truncate strings to make them
 fit a desired context. E.g., you might have a menu that is only 100px wide and
 prefer text doesn't wrap so you'd truncate it around 15-30 characters,
 depending on preference and typeface size. This is trivial with plain text
 using substr but with HTML it is somewhat difficult because whitespace has
 fluid significance and open tags that are not properly closed destroy
 well-formedness and can wreck an entire layout.
 ..
 HTML::Truncate attempts to account for those two problems by padding truncation
 for spacing and entities and closing any tags that remain open at the point of
 truncation.

 The term transliteration describes the conversion of text from one writing
 system or alphabet to another one. The conversion is ideally unique, mapping
 one character to exactly one character, so the original spelling can be
 reconstructed. Practically this is not always the case and one single letter
 of the original alpabet can be transcribed as two, three or even more
 letters.
 .
 Furthermore there is more than one transliteration scheme for one writing
 system. Therefore it is an important and necessary information, which scheme
 will be or has been used to transliterate a text, to work integrative and be
 able to reconstruct the original data.

Description-en: module to find out the times at which a cron entry would run
 Given a line from a crontab, tells you the time at which cron will next run
 the line, or when the last event occurred, relative to any date you choose.
 The object keeps that reference date internally, and updates it when you call
 nextEvent() or previousEvent() - such that successive calls will give you a
 sequence of events going forward, or backwards, in time.
 .
 Use setCounterToNow() to reset this reference time to the current date on
 your system, or use setCounterToDate() to set the reference to any arbitrary
 time, or resetCounter() to take the object back to the date you constructed
 it with.
 .
 Schedule::Cron::Events uses Set::Crontab to understand the date
 specification, so it should be able to handle all forms of cron entries.

Description-md5: cb370b8d5216a7ee6a5025cd0a804f1f
Description-en: kernel module to memory dump (DKMS)
 LiME (Linux Memory Extractor, formerly DMD) is a Loadable Kernel
 Module (LKM), which allows the acquisition of volatile memory (RAM)
 from Linux and Linux-based devices, such as those powered by Android.
 In others words, you can use it to get a memory image from a machine.
 .
 The tool supports acquiring memory either to the file system of the
 device or over the network. LiME is unique in that it is the first
 tool that allows full memory captures from Android devices. It also
 minimizes its interaction between user and kernel space processes
 during acquisition. It will produce memory captures that are more
 forensically sound than those of other tools designed for Linux
 memory acquisition. The dump format provided as "lime" is fully
 compatible with volatility framework.
 .
 This package provides the source code for the lime-forensics kernel
 modules to be build with dkms.
 .
 Kernel source or headers are required to compile these modules.

Package: limnoria
Description-md5: 33156b967de31535f327652d89476669
Description-en: robust and user-friendly Python IRC bot
 A robust, full-featured Python IRC bot with a clean and flexible plugin API.
 Equipped with a complete ACL system for specifying user permissions with as
 much as per-command granularity. Batteries are included in the form of
 numerous plugins already written.
 .
 Limnoria is robust (it doesn't crash), user friendly (it's easy to configure)
 and programmer friendly (plugins are *extremely* easy to write).  It aims to
 be an adequate replacement for most existing IRC bots.
 .
 It is the maintained fork of supybot.
 .
 This package provides Python 3-only modules and scripts.

Package: linssid
Description-md5: 18ad7d8ee4d0bad4e10cd7175c622329
Description-en: graphical wireless scanner
 LinSSID is a graphical program that displays locally receivable 802.11
 wireless attach points and ad hoc networks.
 .
 A table is displayed with various parameters such as MAC address, channel,
 and signal strength. Graphs are also displayed with signal strength by
 channel and signal strength over time.
 .
 LinSSID is graphically and functionally similar to inSSIDer (for Microsoft
 Windows) and Wifi Analyzer (for Android).
 .
 LinSSID can be used to measure the local perfomance or to search for an
 interference free channel to be set in a wireless router (access point).
 The wireless established link won't be affected by these operations because
 LinSSID needn't set the monitor mode in network interface.

Package: lintian
Description-md5: bd50d2f125fc609d90041a144f2246a8
Description-en: Debian package checker
 Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy
 violations. It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian
 policy as well as some checks for common errors.
 .
 It uses an archive directory, called laboratory, in which it stores
 information about the packages it examines.  It can keep this
 information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating
 expensive data-collection operations. This makes it possible to check the
 complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time.
 .
 This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian
 packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer
 should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the
 archive.
 .
 This version of Lintian is calibrated for policy version 3.9.8.

 Suite of daemons for Linux guests running on Hyper-V, consisting of
 hv_fcopy_daemon, hv_kvp_daemon and hv_vss_daemon.
 .
 hv_fcopy_daemon provides the file copy service, allowing the host to copy
 files into the guest.
 .
 hv_kvp_daemon provides the key-value pair (KVP) service, allowing the host
 to get and set the IP networking configuration of the guest.  (This
 requires helper scripts which are not currently included.)
 .
 hv_vss_daemon provides the volume shadow copy service (VSS), allowing the
 host to freeze the guest filesystems while taking a snapshot.

 LibFuzzer is similar in concept to American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), but it performs
 all of its fuzzing inside a single process. This in-process fuzzing can be
 more restrictive and fragile, but is potentially much faster as there is no
 overhead for process start-up.
 .
 The fuzzer is linked with the library under test, and feeds fuzzed inputs to
 the library via a specific fuzzing entrypoint (aka 'target function'); the
 fuzzer then tracks which areas of the code are reached, and generates mutations
 on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code
 coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM's SanitizerCoverage
 instrumentation.

 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 This package provides the OCaml bindings to develop applications using llvm.

 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X86, SparcV9, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Description-en: multiple genome alignment
 Mauve is a system for efficiently constructing multiple genome alignments
 in the presence of large-scale evolutionary events such as rearrangement
 and inversion. Multiple genome alignment provides a basis for research
 into comparative genomics and the study of evolutionary dynamics.  Aligning
 whole genomes is a fundamentally different problem than aligning short
 sequences.
 .
 Mauve has been developed with the idea that a multiple genome aligner
 should require only modest computational resources. It employs algorithmic
 techniques that scale well in the amount of sequence being aligned. For
 example, a pair of Y. pestis genomes can be aligned in under a minute,
 while a group of 9 divergent Enterobacterial genomes can be aligned in
 a few hours.
 .
 Mauve computes and interactively visualizes genome sequence comparisons.
 Using FastA or GenBank sequence data, Mauve constructs multiple genome
 alignments that identify large-scale rearrangement, gene gain, gene loss,
 indels, and nucleotide substutition.
 .
 Mauve is developed at the University of Wisconsin.

Package: mksh
Description-md5: 4931f730b48566d2590b67efc22e6b63
Description-en: MirBSD Korn Shell
 mksh is the successor of the Public Domain Korn shell (pdksh),
 a Bourne/POSIX compatible shell which is largely similar to the
 original AT&T Korn Shell (ksh88/ksh93).
 It includes bug fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a
 modern, robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.
 mksh has UTF-8 support (in string operations and the Emacs editing
 mode). The code has been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed,
 standards compliance added, and several enhancements (for extended
 compatibility to other modern shells, as well as a couple of its
 own) are available.
 This shell is Debian Policy 10.4 compliant and works as /bin/sh on
 Debian systems (use the /bin/lksh executable) and is a good rescue
 and initrd shell (consider the /bin/mksh-static executable).
 .
 The mksh binary is a complete, full-featured shell. It provides a
 “consistent across all platforms” guarantee, using 32-bit integers
 for arithmetics, possibly deviating from POSIX.
 .
 The mksh-static binary is a version of mksh, linked against klibc,
 musl, or dietlibc (if they exist for that Debian architecture and
 are usable) and optimised for small code size, for example for use
 on initrd or initramfs images, installation or rescue systems.
 Except for omitting some features to be smaller, it is similar to
 the mksh binary otherwise. Note the exact feature set may differ
 depending on which C library was used to compile it.
 .
 The lksh binary is a script shell based on mksh intended to run old
 ksh88 and pdksh scripts, but not for interactive use. When used as
 /bin/sh it follows POSIX most closely, including use of the host’s
 “long” C data type for arithmetics. It also contains kludges so it
 can run as /bin/sh on Debian beyond what Policy dictates, to work
 around bugs in maintainer scripts and LSB init scripts shipped by
 many packages, such as including a rudimentary printf(1) builtin,
 permitting a shell function to be named stop overriding the default
 alias, more loose interpretation of shell extglobs, etc.
 .
 A sample ~/.mkshrc is included in /usr/share/doc/mksh/examples and
 provided as /etc/mkshrc conffile, which is sourced by another file
 /etc/skel/.mkshrc users are recommended to copy into their home.

Package: libmtj-java
Description-md5: 83d51bf9bf17c051b3fb647b16f73a89
Description-en: Java library for developing numerical applications
 MTJ is designed to be used as a library for developing numerical
 applications, both for small and large scale computations. The library
 is based on BLAS and LAPACK for its dense and structured sparse
 computations, and on the Templates project for unstructured sparse
 operations.
 .
 MTJ uses the netlib-java project as a backend, which can be set up to
 use machine-optimised BLAS libraries for improved performance of dense
 matrix operations, falling back to a pure Java implementation. This
 ensures perfect portability, while allowing for improved performance in
 a production environment.

 determines the address of each network hop between the machines,
 it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the
 quality of the link to each machine.  As it does this, it prints
 running statistics about each machine.

      total queries. Slow query time limits are also analyzed and
      recommendations are made.
    * Connections: Current and historical connection counts are
      reviewed.
    * Key Buffer: Takes configuration data and compares it to the actual
      indexes found in MyISAM tables. Key cache hit rates are calculated
      and variable adjustments are suggested.
    * Query Cache: Query cache hit rates and usage percentages are used
      to make recommendations for the query cache configuration
      variables.
    * Sorting & Joins: Per-thread buffers that affect sorts and joins
      are reviewed along with the statistics from the queries run
      against the server.
    * Temporary Tables: Variable recommendations are made to reduce
      temporary tables that are written to the disk.
    * Table Cache: Compares total tables opened to the currently open
      tables. Calculates the table cache hit rate in order to make
      suggestions.
    * Open Files: Determines if the server will approach or run into the

Package: libnaga-java
Description-md5: 0dcf32eb94885ccb1351b3ffe18fe908
Description-en: Simplified Java NIO asynchronous sockets
 Naga aims to be a very small NIO library that provides a handful of java
 classes to wrap the usual Socket and ServerSocket with asynchronous NIO
 counterparts.
 .
 All of this is driven from a single thread, making it useful for both client
 (e.g. allowing I/O to be done in the AWT-thread without any need for threads)
 and server programming (1 thread for all connections instead of 2
 threads/connection).
 .
 Naga contains the code needed to get NIO up and running without having to code
 partially read buffers and setting various selection key flags.

Description-en: libraries for using data in the INSDC Sequence Read Archives (devel)
 Much of the data submitted these days, for example in BAM, Illumina
 export.txt, and Complete Genomics formats, contain alignment
 information. With aligned data, NCBI uses Compression by Reference,
 which only stores the differences in base pairs between sequence data
 and the segment it aligns to. The process to restore original data, for
 example as FastQ, requires fast access to the reference sequences that
 the original data was aligned to. NCBI recommends that SRA users
 dedicate local disk space to store references downloaded from the NCBI
 SRA site. As of Fall 2014, the complete collection of these reference
 sequences is 66 GB. While it isn't usually necessary to download the
 entirety of the reference sequences, this should give you an idea of the
 scale of the storage requirement. By default, the Toolkit will download
 missing reference sequences on demand and cache them in the user's home
 directory. The location of this cache is configurable, as is whether the
 download is automatic or manual.
 .
 This is the development package.

  * Data de-duplication, across files, and backup generations. If the backup
    repository already contains a particular chunk of data, it will be re-used,
    even if it was in another file in an older backup generation. This way, you
    don't need to worry about moving around large files, or modifying them.
  * Encrypted backups, using GnuPG.
  * Push or pull operation, depending on what you need. You can run Obnam on
    the client, and push backups to the server, or on the server, and pull
    from the client over SFTP.

Description-md5: 4db510f429382469247db91a4d396ce4
Description-en: OpenConnect VPN server compatible with Cisco AnyConnect VPN
 OpenConnect server (ocserv) is an SSL VPN server. Its purpose is to be a
 secure, small, fast and configurable VPN server. It implements the OpenConnect
 SSL VPN protocol, and has also (currently experimental) compatibility with
 clients using the AnyConnect SSL VPN protocol. The OpenConnect VPN protocol
 uses the standard IETF security protocols such as TLS 1.2, and Datagram TLS to
 provide the secure VPN service. The server is implemented primarily for the
 GNU/Linux platform but its code is designed to be portable to other UNIX
 variants as well.
 .
 Ocserv's main feature is isolation of the VPN users from the main VPN server
 process. Each authenticated user is assigned an unprivileged worker process,
 and a networking (tun) device. That not only eases the control of the resources
 of each user or group of users, but also prevents privilege escalation due to
 any bug on the VPN handling (worker) server. Each VPN user can be authenticated
 using password, PAM, public key (in a smart card or not) or any combination of
 methods.

Package: pbdagcon
Description-md5: 95465f5fc6fbaa2db477a48c78b7cd82
Description-en: sequence consensus using directed acyclic graphs
 pbdagcon is a tool that implements DAGCon (Directed Acyclic Graph Consensus)
 which is a sequence consensus algorithm based on using directed acyclic
 graphs to encode multiple sequence alignment.
 .
 It uses the alignment information from blasr to align sequence reads to a
 "backbone" sequence. Based on the underlying alignment directed acyclic graph
 (DAG), it will be able to use the new information from the reads to find the
 discrepancies between the reads and the "backbone" sequences. A dynamic
 programming process is then applied to the DAG to find the optimum sequence
 of bases as the consensus. The new consensus can be used as a new backbone
 sequence to iteratively improve the consensus quality.
 .
 While the code is developed for processing PacBio(TM) raw sequence data,
 the algorithm can be used for general consensus purpose. Currently, it only
 takes FASTA input. For shorter read sequences, one might need to adjust the
 blasr alignment parameters to get the alignment string properly.
 .
 The code and the underlying graphical data structure have been used for some
 algorithm development prototyping including phasing reads and pre-assembly.

Package: phyml
Description-md5: e17d56691eaa63bb88fc849229a6c8a4
Description-en: Phylogenetic estimation using Maximum Likelihood
 PhyML is a software that estimates maximum likelihood phylogenies from
 alignments of nucleotide or amino acid sequences. It provides a wide
 range of options that were designed to facilitate standard phylogenetic
 analyses. The main strengths of PhyML lies in the large number of
 substitution models coupled to various options to search the space of
 phylogenetic tree topologies, going from very fast and efficient methods
 to slower but generally more accurate approaches. It also implements
 two methods to evaluate branch supports in a sound statistical framework
 (the non-parametric bootstrap and the approximate likelihood ratio test).
 .
 PhyML was designed to process moderate to large data sets. In theory,
 alignments with up to 4,000 sequences 2,000,000 character-long can
 be analyzed. In  practice however, the amount of memory required to process
 a data set is proportional of the product of the number of sequences by their
 length. Hence, a large number of sequences can only be processed provided
 that they are short. Also, PhyML can handle long sequences provided that
 they are not numerous. With most standard personal computers, the “comfort
 zone” for PhyML generally lies around 3 to 500 sequences less than 2,000
 character long.
 .
 This package also includes PhyTime.

 shared libraries with CMake.

Package: libdlrestrictions1
Description-md5: 28164c3828b6557ee21d394cbcb4648a
Description-en: library that implements library compatibility checks for dlopen()
 This package provides a DLRestrictions library that can be used to check
 compatibility of the external shared library (or plugin) against other
 libraries currently loaded in the global symbol object. It might help to avoid
 symbol clashes and provide means for graceful failure detection in advance
 before the first dlsym() call. Otherwise, usage of incompatible library might
 result in crashes or other unpredictable failures of the application.
 .
 A shared library that is protected by DLRestrictions provides a special symbol
 which defines conditions under which the library may be safely used. At the
 moment, the only restriction that may be imposed controls whether multiple
 SONAMEs of the same library can safely co-exist in the same symbol space.
 Shared library dependencies are also checked for compatibility.

 This package contains a variety of packaging tools and build scripts that may
 be very useful when packaging KDE applications. Even if you are a maintainer
 of a very small KDE application, this package should be worthwhile checking
 out.
 .
 Main highlights:
  - recommended build flags for building packages based on the KDE Platform;
  - cdbs class for building packages based on the KDE Platform (kde.mk);
  - debhelper build system (--buildsystem=kde) and dh addon (--with kde) for
    building packages based on the KDE Platform;
  - dh_sameversiondep for generating a dependency that is versioned the same
    way as a dependency (coming from the same source) of another reference
    package.
  - dh_movelibkdeinit for moving libkdeinit4_*.so libraries to private
    location;
  - dh_sodeps (and sodeps dh addon) for generating so:Depends substvar for -dev
    packages based to which local packages lib*.so symlinks point to;
  - pkgkde-symbolshelper tool for efficient management of C and C++ symbol
    files;
  - pkgkde-debs2symbols tool for generating symbol files and symbol file
    patches from pre-built binaries in the deb packages;
  - pkgkde-getbuildlogs tool for downloading build logs for the specified
    package (from buildd.debian.org);
  - pkgkde-override-sc-dev-latest tool for overriding Breaks of the
    kde-sc-dev-latest package;
  - pkgkde-vcs tool for performing common tasks when packaging under VCS.
 .
 NOTE: since this package is cumulative, it does not depend on the packages it
 provides helpers for. I.e. you still need to explicitly build depend on
 debhelper or cdbs in your packages.

Package: prodigal
Description-md5: 17547e924925fa3b22bf27a8a6cf1be5
Description-en: Microbial (bacterial and archaeal) gene finding program
 Prodigal (Prokaryotic Dynamic Programming Genefinding Algorithm) is a
 microbial (bacterial and archaeal) gene finding program developed at
 Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of Tennessee.
 Key features of Prodigal include:
 .
 Speed: Prodigal is an extremely fast gene recognition tool
 (written in very vanilla C). It can analyze an entire microbial genome
 in 30 seconds or less.
 .
 Accuracy: Prodigal is a highly accurate gene finder.
 It correctly locates the 3' end of every gene in the experimentally verified
 Ecogene data set (except those containing introns).
 It possesses a very sophisticated ribosomal binding site scoring system that
 enables it to locate the translation initiation site with great accuracy
 (96% of the 5' ends in the Ecogene data set are located correctly).
 .
 Specificity: Prodigal's false positive rate compares favorably with other
 gene identification programs, and usually falls under 5%.
 .
 GC-Content Indifferent: Prodigal performs well even in high GC genomes,
 with over a 90% perfect match (5'+3') to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa curated
 annotations.
 .
 Metagenomic Version: Prodigal can run in metagenomic mode and analyze
 sequences even when the organism is unknown.
 .
 Ease of Use: Prodigal can be run in one step on a single genomic sequence
 or on a draft genome containing many sequences. It does not need to be
 supplied with any knowledge of the organism, as it learns all the properties
 it needs to on its own.

Package: progressivemauve
Description-md5: 1b3a5c7db196a734331de35b5112fef8
Description-en: multiple genome alignment algorithms
 The mauveAligner and progressiveMauve alignment algorithms have been
 implemented as command-line programs included with the downloadable Mauve
 software.  When run from the command-line, these programs provide options
 not yet available in the graphical interface.
 .
 Mauve is a system for efficiently constructing multiple genome alignments
 in the presence of large-scale evolutionary events such as rearrangement
 and inversion. Multiple genome alignment provides a basis for research
 into comparative genomics and the study of evolutionary dynamics.  Aligning
 whole genomes is a fundamentally different problem than aligning short
 sequences.
 .
 Mauve has been developed with the idea that a multiple genome aligner
 should require only modest computational resources. It employs algorithmic
 techniques that scale well in the amount of sequence being aligned. For
 example, a pair of Y. pestis genomes can be aligned in under a minute,
 while a group of 9 divergent Enterobacterial genomes can be aligned in
 a few hours.
 .
 Mauve computes and interactively visualizes genome sequence comparisons.
 Using FastA or GenBank sequence data, Mauve constructs multiple genome
 alignments that identify large-scale rearrangement, gene gain, gene loss,
 indels, and nucleotide substutition.
 .
 Mauve is developed at the University of Wisconsin.

Package: prometheus
Description-md5: 7f48f84a4177e99e795f6f034f9349c3
Description-en: Monitoring system and time series database
 Prometheus is a systems and services monitoring system. It collects metrics
 from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions,
 displays the results, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed to
 be true.
 .
 Prometheus' main distinguishing features as compared to other monitoring
 systems are:
 .
  * A multi-dimensional data model (timeseries defined by metric name and set
    of key/value dimensions).
  * A flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality.
  * No dependency on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous.
  * Timeseries collection happens via a pull model over HTTP.
  * Pushing timeseries is supported via an intermediary gateway.
  * Targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration.
  * Multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support.
  * Federation support coming soon.

Package: prometheus-pushgateway
Description-md5: 95fbeb244faa98192d9c460610063023
Description-en: Prometheus exporter for ephemereal jobs
 The Prometheus Pushgateway exists to allow ephemeral and batch jobs to expose
 their metrics to Prometheus. Since these kinds of jobs may not exist long
 enough to be scraped, they can instead push their metrics to a Pushgateway.
 The Pushgateway then exposes these metrics to Prometheus.
 .
 The Pushgateway is explicitly not an aggregator, but rather a metrics cache.
 It does not have a statsd-like semantics. The metrics pushed are exactly the
 same as you would present for scraping in a permanently running program.
 .
 For machine-level metrics, the textfile collector of prometheus-node-exporter
 is usually more appropriate. The Pushgateway is best used for service-level
 metrics.

Package: prottest
Description-md5: 1454155e5ec803ebc286ba865e4e36cf
Description-en: selection of best-fit models of protein evolution
 PROTTEST (ModelTest's relative) is a program for selecting the model of
 protein evolution that best fits a given set of sequences (alignment).
 This java program is based on the Phyml program (for maximum likelihood
 calculations and optimization of parameters) and uses the PAL library as
 well. Models included are empirical substitution matrices (such as WAG,
 LG, mtREV, Dayhoff, DCMut, JTT, VT, Blosum62, CpREV, RtREV, MtMam,
 MtArt, HIVb, and HIVw) that indicate relative rates of amino acid
 replacement, and specific improvements (+I:invariable sites, +G: rate
 heterogeneity among sites, +F: observed amino acid frequencies) to
 account for the evolutionary constraints impossed by conservation of
 protein structure and function. ProtTest uses the Akaike Information
 Criterion (AIC) and other statistics (AICc and BIC) to find which of the
 candidate models best fits the data at hand.

Package: pyconfigure
Description-md5: f9161d1eb2bd0f630c72da11f6f6347c
Description-en: automatic configure script builder for Python software
 GNU pyconfigure provides developers with file templates for implementing
 standard `configure' scripts and `Makefile' recipes for their Python packages.
 pyconfigure supports different project needs, allowing you to write your
 build/install logic in Python or in Make. Developers with existing packages
 need not worry, as pyconfigure integrates well with what you have already
 written.
 .
 While the goal is to make it easier for Python packages to provide the
 standard configuration and installation procedure, pyconfigure also offers
 other advantages over the traditional Python-based methods. Because much of
 pyconfigure is based upon the powerful GNU Autoconf, packages that use
 additional languages such as C or Fortran automatically benefit from existing
 support without having to hack it in oneself, as in other Python-based
 solutions. Opting to use Make to write your installation logic provides you
 with a powerful, robust and flexible system that has been designed
 specifically with such processes in mind.

Package: pyfai
Description-md5: 99681480cbe1e9374e4e00c9c53fdf90
Description-en: Fast Azimuthal Integration scripts
 PyFAI is a Python library for azimuthal integration; it allows the conversion
 of diffraction images taken with 2D detectors like CCD cameras into X-Ray
 powder patterns that can be used by other software like Rietveld refinement
 tools (i.e. FullProf), phase analysis or texture analysis.
 .
 As PyFAI is a library, its main goal is to be integrated in other tools like
 PyMca, LiMa or EDNA. To perform online data analysis, the precise description
 of the experimental setup has to be known. This is the reason why PyFAI
 includes geometry optimization code working on "powder rings" of reference
 samples. Alternatively, PyFAI can also import geometries fitted with other
 tools like Fit2D.
 .
 PyFAI has been designed to work with any kind of detector with any geometry
 (transmission, reflection, off-axis, ...). It uses the Python library FabIO
 to read most images taken by diffractometer.

Description-en: xdist plugin for py.test
 The pytest-xdist plugin extends py.test with some unique test execution modes:
 .
  * Looponfail:
      Run your tests repeatedly in a subprocess. After each run py.test waits
      until a file in your project changes and then re-runs the previously
      failing tests. This is repeated until all tests pass after which again a
      full run is performed.
  * Load-balancing:
      if you have multiple CPUs or hosts you can use those for a combined test
      run. This allows one to speed up development or to use special resources
      of remote machines.
  * Multi-Platform coverage:
      you can specify different Python interpreters or different platforms and
      run tests in parallel on all of them.
 .
 Before running tests remotely, py.test efficiently synchronizes your program
 source code to the remote place. All test results are reported back and
 displayed to your local test session. You may specify different Python
 versions and interpreters.

Description-en: Phylogenetic Tree Summarization and Annotation
 SumTrees is a program to summarize non-parameteric bootstrap or
 Bayesian posterior probability support for splits or clades on
 phylogenetic trees.
 .
 The basis of the support assessment is typically given by a set of
 non-parametric bootstrap replicate tree samples produced by programs
 such as GARLI or RAxML, or by a set of MCMC tree samples produced by
 programs such as Mr. Bayes or BEAST. The proportion of trees out of the
 samples in which a particular split is found is taken to be the degree
 of support for that split as indicated by the samples. The samples that
 are the basis of the support can be distributed across multiple files,
 and a burn-in option allows for an initial number of trees in each file
 to be excluded from the analysis if they are not considered to be drawn
 from the true support distribution.

 .
  * allows you to send multiple requests right after each other without having
    to read the responses first.
  * supports waiting for 100-continue before sending the request body.
  * raises an exception instead of silently delivering partial data if the
    connection is closed before all data has been received.
  * raises one specific exception (ConnectionClosed) if the connection has been
    closed (while http.client connection may raise any of BrokenPipeError,
    BadStatusLine, ConnectionAbortedError, ConnectionResetError, IncompleteRead
    or simply return '' on read)
  * supports non-blocking, asynchronous operation and is compatible with the
    asyncio module.
  * can in most cases distinguish between an unavailable DNS server and
    an unresolvable hostname.
  * is not compatible with old HTTP 0.9 or 1.0 servers.
 .
 All request and response headers are represented as str, but must be encodable
 in latin1. Request and response body must be bytes-like objects or binary
 streams.

Package: python-fudge
Description-md5: 220ebbdc1e66cc2f9a09f2ae9ba9eebb
Description-en: Python 2 module for using fake objects for tests
 Fudge is a Python module for using fake objects (mocks and stubs) to
 test real ones.
 .
 In readable Python code, you declare what methods are available on
 your fake and how they should be called. Then you inject that into
 your application and start testing. This declarative approach means
 you don’t have to record and playback actions and you don’t have to
 inspect your fakes after running code. If the fake object was used
 incorrectly then you’ll see an informative exception message with a
 traceback that points to the culprit.
 .
 Fudge was inspired by Mocha which is a simpler version of jMock. But
 unlike Mocha, Fudge does not automatically hijack real objects; you
 explicitly patch them in your test. And unlike jMock, Fudge is only
 as strict about expectations as you want it to be. If the type of
 arguments sent to the fake method aren’t important then you don’t
 have to declare an expectation for them.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.

Package: python-gabbi
Description-md5: d61b4fcb2fe54cb7bc1860d8d564512a
Description-en: declarative HTTP testing library - Python 2.x
 Gabbi is a tool for running HTTP tests where requests and responses are
 represented in a declarative form.
 .
 Gabbi works to bridge the gap between human readable YAML files that represent
 HTTP requests and expected responses and the obscured realm of Python-based,
 object-oriented unit tests in the style of the unittest module and its
 derivatives.
 .
 Each YAML file represents an ordered list of HTTP requests along with the
 expected responses. This allows a single file to represent a process in the
 API being tested. For example:
 .
  * Create a resource.
  * Retrieve a resource.
  * Delete a resource.
  * Retrieve a resource again to confirm it is gone.
 .
 At the same time it is still possible to ask gabbi to run just one request.
 If it is in a sequence of tests, those tests prior to it in the YAML file will
 be run (in order). In any single process any test will only be run once.
 Concurrency is handled such that one file runs in one process.
 .
 These features mean that it is possible to create tests that are useful for
 both humans (as tools for improving and developing APIs) and automated CI
 systems.

 This library provides a robust and significantly extended implementation of
 JSONPath for Python. It is tested with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.3.

 This library differs from other JSONPath implementations in that it is a full
 language implementation, meaning the JSONPath expressions are first class
 objects, easy to analyze, transform, parse, print, and extend.
 .
 The JSONPath syntax supported by this library includes some additional
 features and omits some problematic features (those that make it unportable).
 In particular, some new operators such as "|" and "where" are available, and
 parentheses are used for grouping not for callbacks into Python, since with
 these changes the language is not trivially associative. Also, fields may be
 quoted whether or not they are contained in brackets.

Package: python-lockfile
Description-md5: 99918331539000a98062b881836b13d4
Description-en: file locking library for Python — Python 2 library
 The ‘lockfile’ library exports a ‘LockFile’ class which provides a
 simple API for locking files.
 .
 The appropriate implementation for ‘LockFile’ is chosen automatically
 based on the OS capabilities for an atomic filesystem operation.
 These implementations are also available for explicit use as
 ‘LinkLockFile’ and ‘MkdirLockFile’.
 .
 Other back ends are possible with the same semantics. Examples
 included are:
  * ‘SQLiteLockFile’, using records in an SQLite database.
  * ‘PIDLockFile’, using the semantics of a Unix PID file.
 .
 Unlike other Python locking libraries (the Windows ‘msvcrt.locking’
 function, the Unix ‘fcntl.flock’, ‘fcntl.lockf’, and the deprecated
 ‘posixfile’ module), the API is identical across both Unix (including
 GNU/Linux and MacOS) and Windows platforms.

 OpenStack uses multiple services from different projects. In the case somethin
 works too slowly, it's extremely complicated to understand what exactly goes
 wrong and to locate the bottleneck.

  * Generate AUTHORS file from git log
  * Generate ChangeLog from git log
  * Generate Sphinx autodoc stub files for your whole module
  * Store your dependencies in a pip requirements file
  * Use your README file as a long_description
  * Smartly find packages under your root package

 PBR is only mildly configurable. The basic idea is that there's a decent way
 to run things and if you do, you should reap the rewards, because then it's
 simple and repeatable. If you want to do things differently, cool! But you've
 already got the power of Python at your fingertips, so you don't really need

Description-en: module to produce pretty and readable YAML-serialized data (Python 2)
 YAML is generally nice and easy format to read if it was written by humans.
 PyYAML can a do fairly decent job of making stuff readable. pyaml tries to
 improve on that a bit, with the following tweaks:
 .
   - Most human-friendly representation options in PyYAML get picked as
     defaults.
   - Does not dump "null" values, if possible, replacing these with just empty
     strings, which have the same meaning but reduce visual clutter and are
     easier to edit.
   - Dicts, sets, OrderedDicts, defaultdicts, namedtuples, etc are
     representable and get sorted on output (OrderedDicts and namedtuples keep
     their ordering), so that output would be as diff-friendly as possible,
     and not arbitrarily depend on Python internals.
   - It appears that at least recent PyYAML versions also do such sorting for
     Python dicts.
   - List items get indented, as they should be.
   - bytestrings that can't be auto-converted to unicode raise error, as yaml
     has no "binary bytes" (i.e. unix strings) type.
   - Attempt is made to pick more readable string representation styles,
     depending on the value.
   - "force_embed" option to avoid having &id stuff scattered all over the
     output (which might be beneficial in some cases, hence the option).
   - "&id" anchors, if used, get labels from the keys they get attached to, not
     just use meaningless enumerators.
   - "string_val_style" option to only apply to strings that are values, not
     keys.
   - Has an option to add vertical spacing (empty lines) between keys on
     different depths, to make output much more seekable.

Description-md5: a76bf947bc87b9f620e347a6289347e5
Description-en: Example data for Variant Call Format (VCF) parser for Python
 The Variant Call Format (VCF) specifies the format of a text file used
 in bioinformatics for storing gene sequence variations. The format has
 been developed with the advent of large-scale genotyping and DNA
 sequencing projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project.
 .
 The intent of this module is to mimic the ``csv`` module in the Python
 stdlib, as opposed to more flexible serialization formats like JSON or
 YAML. ``vcf`` will attempt to parse the content of each record based on
 the data types specified in the meta-information lines -- specifically
 the ##INFO and
 ##FORMAT lines. If these lines are missing or incomplete, it will check
 against the reserved types mentioned in the spec. Failing that, it will
 just return strings.

 This package provides example data to test the Python modules.

Description-en: javascript minifier written in Python - Python 2.7
 rJSmin is a javascript minifier written in Python. The minifier is based on
 the semantics of jsmin.c by Douglas Crockford.
 .
 The module is a re-implementation aiming for speed, so it can be used at
 runtime (rather than during a preprocessing step). Usually it produces the
 same results as the original jsmin.c. It differs in the following ways:
 .
  - there is no error detection: unterminated string, regex and comment
    literals are treated as regular javascript code and minified as such.
  - Control characters inside string and regex literals are left untouched; they
    are not converted to spaces (nor to)
  - Newline characters are not allowed inside string and regex literals, except
    for line continuations in string literals (ECMA-5).
  - "return /regex/" is recognized correctly.
  - Line terminators after regex literals are handled more sensibly
  - "+ +" and "- -" sequences are not collapsed to '++' or '--'
  - Newlines before ! operators are removed more sensibly
  - Comments starting with an exclamation mark (!) can be kept optionally
  - rJSmin does not handle streams, but only complete strings. (However, the
    module provides a "streamy" interface).
 .
 Since most parts of the logic are handled by the regex engine it's way faster
 than the original Python port of jsmin.c by Baruch Even. The speed factor
 varies between about 6 and 55 depending on input and Python version (it gets
 faster the more compressed the input already is).  Compared to the
 speed-refactored Python port by Dave St.Germain the performance gain is less
 dramatic but still between 3 and 50 (for huge inputs)). See the
 docs/BENCHMARKS file for details.

Package: python-stetl
Description-md5: c29b79b652a8e1ea9a93e4bd3edae4a8
Description-en: Streaming ETL - Geospatial ETL framework for Python 2
 Stetl, streaming ETL, pronounced "staedl", is a lightweight ETL-framework
 for the conversion of rich (as GML) geospatial data conversion.
 .
 It basically glues together existing parsing and transformation tools
 like GDAL/OGR (ogr2ogr) and XSLT. By using native tools like libxml and
 libxslt (via Python lxml) Stetl is speed-optimized.
 .
 Stetl has a similar design as Spring (Java) and other modern frameworks
 based on IoC (Inversion of Control). A configuration file (in Python
 config format) specifies your chain of ETL steps. This chain is formed
 by a series of Python modules/objects and their parameters. These are
 symbolically specified in the config file. You just invoke etl.py the
 main program with a config file. The config file specifies the input
 modules (e.g. PostGIS), transformers (e.g. XSLT) and outputs (e.g. a GML
 file or even WFS-T a geospatial protocol to publish GML to a server).
 .
 This package contains the module for Python 2.

Package: python-swiftclient
Description-md5: 9c991883ffc480d9f9e5cb5c81988b77
Description-en: Client library for Openstack Swift API - Python 2.7
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) creates redundant, scalable object
 storage using clusters of standardized servers to store petabytes of
 accessible data. It is not a file system or real-time data storage system, but
 rather a long-term storage system for a more permanent type of static data
 that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then updated if necessary. Primary
 examples of data that best fit this type of storage model are virtual machine
 images, photo storage, email storage and backup archiving. Having no central
 "brain" or master point of control provides greater scalability, redundancy
 and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides a client for the OpenStack Swift API. There's a Python
 API  (the "swiftclient" module), and a command-line script ("swift").

Description-en: Python 2.7 bindings for interacting with Vagrant virtual machines
 python-vagrant is a Python module that provides a _thin_ wrapper
 around the `vagrant` command line executable, allowing programmatic
 control of Vagrant virtual machines (boxes).  This project began to
 create Python bindings for Vagrant to programmatically access vagrant
 boxes using Fabric. This module is useful for:
 .
  - Starting a Vagrant virtual machine (VM) (`up`)
  - Terminating a Vagrant VM (`destroy`)
  - Halting a Vagrant VM without destroying it (`halt`)
  - Querying the status of a VM or VMs (`status`)
  - Getting ssh configuration information useful for SSHing into the
    VM (`host`, `port`, ...)
  - Running `vagrant` commands in a multi-VM environment
    (http://vagrantup.com/v1/docs/multivm.html) by using `vm_name`
    parameter
  - Initializing the VM based on a named base box, using init().
  - Adding, Removing, and Listing boxes (`box add`, `box remove`,
    `box list`)
  - Provisioning VMs - up() accepts options like `no_provision`,
    `provision`, and `provision_with`, and there is a `provision()`
    method
  - Using sandbox mode from the Sahara gem:
    https://github.com/jedi4ever/sahara
 .
 This package is _beta_ and its API is not guaranteed to be
 stable. The API attempts to be congruent with the `vagrant` API
 terminology, to facilitate knowledge transfer for users already
 familiar with Vagrant. Over time, the python-vagrant API has changed
 to better match the underling `vagrant` CLI and to evolve with the
 changes in that CLI.
 .
 The package version numbering is in the form `0.X.Y`. The initial `0`
 reflects the _beta_ nature of this project. The number `X` is
 incremented when backwards-incompatible changes occur. The number `Y`
 is incremented when backwards-compatible features or bug fixes are
 added.

 Testing a WSGI application normally involves starting a server at a local host
 and port, then pointing your test code to that address. Instead, this library
 lets you intercept calls to any specific host/port combination and redirect
 them into a WSGI application importable by your test program. Thus, you can
 avoid spawning multiple processes or threads to test your Web app.
 .
 wsgi_intercept works by replacing httplib.HTTPConnection with a subclass,
 wsgi_intercept.WSGI_HTTPConnection. This class then redirects specific
 server/port combinations into a WSGI application by emulating a socket. If no
 intercept is registered for the host and port requested, those requests are
 passed on to the standard handler.

 XStatic is a packaging standard to package external (often 3rd party) static
 files as a Python package, so they are easily usable on all operating systems,

 .
 Many Python projects need to use some specific data files, like javascript,
 css, java applets, images, etc. Sometimes these files belong to YOUR project
 (then you may want to package them separately, but you could also just put
 them into your main package). But in many other cases, those files are
 maintained by someone else (like jQuery javascript library or even much bigger
 js libraries or applications) and you definitely do not really want to merge
 them into your project. So, you want to have static file packages, but you
 don’t want to get lots of stuff you do not want. Thus, stuff required by
 XStatic file packages (especially the main, toplevel XStatic package) tries to
 obey to be a MINIMAL, no-fat thing. XStatic doesn't "sell" any web framework
 or other stuff you don't want. Maybe there will be optional XStatic extensions
 for all sorts of stuff, but they won't be required if you just want the files.

Description-en: Angular JS Mock XStatic support - Python 2.x
 XStatic is a packaging standard to package external (often 3rd party) static
 files as a Python package, so they are easily usable on all operating systems,
 with any package management system or even without one.
 .
 Many Python projects need to use some specific data files, like javascript,
 css, java applets, images, etc. Sometimes these files belong to YOUR project
 (then you may want to package them separately, but you could also just put
 them into your main package). But in many other cases, those files are
 maintained by someone else (like jQuery javascript library or even much bigger
 js libraries or applications) and you definitely do not really want to merge
 them into your project. So, you want to have static file packages, but you
 don’t want to get lots of stuff you do not want. Thus, stuff required by
 XStatic file packages (especially the main, toplevel XStatic package) tries to
 obey to be a MINIMAL, no-fat thing. XStatic doesn't "sell" any web framework
 or other stuff you don't want. Maybe there will be optional XStatic extensions
 for all sorts of stuff, but they won't be required if you just want the files.
 .
 By having static files in packages, it is also easier to build virtual envs,
 support linux/bsd/... distribution package maintainers and even windows
 installs using the same mechanism.

 XStatic is a packaging standard to package external (often 3rd party) static
 files as a Python package, so they are easily usable on all operating systems,
 with any package management system or even without one.
 .
 Many Python projects need to use some specific data files, like javascript,
 css, java applets, images, etc. Sometimes these files belong to YOUR project
 (then you may want to package them separately, but you could also just put
 them into your main package). But in many other cases, those files are
 maintained by someone else (like jQuery javascript library or even much bigger
 js libraries or applications) and you definitely do not really want to merge
 them into your project. So, you want to have static file packages, but you
 don’t want to get lots of stuff you do not want. Thus, stuff required by
 XStatic file packages (especially the main, toplevel XStatic package) tries to
 obey to be a MINIMAL, no-fat thing. XStatic doesn't "sell" any web framework
 or other stuff you don't want. Maybe there will be optional XStatic extensions
 for all sorts of stuff, but they won't be required if you just want the files.
 .
 By having static files in packages, it is also easier to build virtual envs,
 support linux/bsd/... distribution package maintainers and even windows
 installs using the same mechanism.

Package: python-dialog
Description-md5: 7a6f150437bc41cc227d7542afdfc94f
Description-en: Python 2 module for making simple terminal-based user interfaces
 pythondialog is a Python wrapper for the dialog utility originally
 written by Savio Lam, and later rewritten by Thomas E. Dickey. Its
 purpose is to provide an easy to use, pythonic and comprehensive Python
 interface to dialog. This allows one to make simple text-mode user
 interfaces on Unix-like systems.
 .
 pythondialog provides dialog boxes (widgets) of many different types.
 Among these, one can find infobox, msgbox, yesno, menu, checklist,
 radiolist, fselect (for selecting a file), rangebox, buildlist,
 treeview, calendar. These widgets, and those not listed here, allow one
 to build nice interfaces quickly and easily. However, it is not possible
 to create new widgets without modifying dialog itself.
 .
 For most widgets, the following settings can be chosen:
  * width, height and other parameters where applicable;
  * two user-defined buttons, referred to as "Help" and "Extra", may be
    added and their labels freely chosen.
 Additionally, a color theme may be defined for all widgets via a
 configuration file.
 .
 pythondialog has good Unicode support. Precisely, this support should be
 as good as allowed by the combination of the Python interpreter, dialog,
 the terminal and the locale settings in use.
 .
 This version is a backport of pythondialog to Python 2. Unless you really
 have to use Python 2, you should use the python3-dialog package.

Package: qlandkartegt
Description-md5: 6211fe13f2c38a294f1a5599db38d5cc
Description-en: GPS mapping (GeoTiff and vector) and GPSr management
 This package provides a versatile tool for GPS maps in GeoTiff format as
 well as Garmin's img vector map format. QLandkarteGT is the successor of
 QLandkarte. Among various improvements (e.g. 2D/3D map rendering and
 reduced resource demands) the major difference is its
 device-independent architecture, which is not limited to Garmin devices
 anymore. Therefore, the package also does not include device drivers.
 Drivers for a number of Garmin devices are available from the
 qlandkartegt-garmin package.
 .
 Additionally, QLandkarteGT serves as a frontend to the GDAL tools, to
 make georeferencing of scanned maps feasible for users. In contrast to
 similar tools (e.g. QGis) its straightforward interface is especially
 suited for non-scientific users.

 R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists
 of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger,
 access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs
 stored in script files.
 .
 The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
 Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the
 resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying
 implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.
 .
 The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows
 branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
 Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is
 possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the
 C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core
 functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a
 large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math
 computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide
 a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data
 presentations.

 Additionally, several thousand extension "packages" are available from
 CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian packages,
 named 'r-cran-<name>'.

 that aims towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. Integer,
 floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset of
 trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions are
 provided through optional integration with LAPACK and ATLAS libraries.
 .
 A delayed evaluation approach is employed (during compile time) to combine
 several operations into one, and to reduce (or eliminate) the need for
 temporaries. This is accomplished through recursive templates and template
 meta-programming.
 .
 This library is useful if C++ has been decided as the language of choice
 (due to speed and/or integration capabilities), rather than another language.
 .
 The RcppArmadillo package includes the header files from the
 templated Armadillo library. Thus users do not need to install
 Armadillo itself in order to use RcppArmadillo.
 .
 This Armadillo integration provides a nice illustration of the
 capabilities of the Rcpp package for seamless R and C++ integration.
 .

 The program implements an approach for the de novo identification and
 classification of repeat sequence families that is based on extensions
 to the usual approach of single linkage clustering of local pairwise
 alignments between genomic sequences. The extensions use multiple
 alignment information to define the boundaries of individual copies of
 the repeats and to distinguish homologous but distinct repeat element
 families. When tested on the human genome, this approach was able to
 properly identify and group known transposable elements. The program,
 should be useful for first-pass automatic classification of repeats in
 newly sequenced genomes.

 Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a
 previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential
 maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by
 seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners
 by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550
 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server,
 while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In
 addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can
 discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is
 also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454
 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons,
 the authors experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice
 junctions with an 80-90% success rate, corroborating the high precision

Package: ruby-nio4r
Description-md5: 517e4f005b34b5c4fd9a4d76ac0a0c97
Description-en: Ruby library providing a selector API for monitoring IO objects
 nio4r (New IO for Ruby) provides an abstract, cross-platform stateful
 I/O selector API for Ruby. I/O selectors are the heart of
 "reactor"-based event loops, and monitor multiple I/O objects for
 various types of readiness, e.g. ready for reading or writing.
 .
 The most similar API provided by Ruby today is Kernel.select, however
 the select API requires you to pass in arrays of all of the I/O
 objects you're interested in every time. nio4r provides a more
 object-oriented API that lets you register I/O objects with a selector
 then handle them when they're selected for various types of events.
 .
 nio4r is modeled after the Java NIO API, but simplified for
 ease-of-use.
 .
 Its goals are:
 .
  * Expose high-level interfaces for stateful IO selectors.
  * Keep the API small to maximize both portability and performance across
    many different OSes and Ruby VMs.
  * Provide inherently thread-safe facilities for working with IO objects.

Package: safecopy
Description-md5: 0357e342b5dc17b9b323beead61e5104
Description-en: data recovery tool for problematic or damaged media
 Safecopy tries to get as much data from SOURCE as possible, even resorting
 to device specific low level operations if applicable. This is achieved by
 identifying problematic or damaged areas, skipping over them and continuing
 reading afterwards. The corresponding area in the destination file is either
 skipped (on initial creation that means padded with zeros) or deliberately
 filled with a recognizable pattern to later find affected files on a corrupted
 device. The work is similar to ddrescue, generating an image of the original
 media. This media can be floppy disks, harddisk partitions, CDs, DVDs, tape
 devices, where other tools like dd would fail due to I/O errors.
 .
 Safecopy uses an incremental algorithm to identify the exact beginning and
 end of bad areas, allowing the user to trade minimum accesses to bad areas
 for thorough data resurrection.
 .
 Multiple passes over the same file are possible, to first retrieve as much
 data from a device as possible with minimum harm, and then trying to retrieve
 some of the remaining data with increasingly aggressive read attempts.

Description-en: Tool for building Debian binary packages from Debian sources
 The sbuild suite of programs (buildd and sbuild) are used to build
 binary packages from source packages.  sbuild does the actual package
 building.
 .
 sbuild uses chroots to build packages, which act as virtual, minimal
 operating system installations dedicated to package building.  This
 means that a number of environments may be used for building
 simultaneously on the same machines, for example stable, testing,
 unstable and experimental.  When coupled with schroot to create
 snapshots of chroots, sbuild may be used to build many packages in
 parallel.  A chroot environment allows packages to be built in a
 controlled, clean environment.  sbuild installs only essential and
 build-essential packages, plus those in the package build
 dependencies.

Package: dchroot
Description-md5: 1c3c5fa410a563eef041e2880c4a90e8

 dchroot allows users to execute commands or interactive shells in
 different chroots.  A typical installation might provide 'stable',
 'testing' and 'unstable' chroots.  Users can move between chroots as
 necessary.
 .
 NOTE: the schroot package provides a better implementation of
 dchroot.  In particular:
  * dchroot quoting issues are not present.  dchroot runs commands in
    the chroot with -c option of the user's default shell; when
    multiple command options are used, the options are concatenated
    together, separated by spaces.  This concatenation breaks shell
    quoting.
  * schroot implements fine-grained access controls based on users
    and groups, either of which may be granted the ability to gain
    root access to the chroot if required.
 Using schroot will avoid these issues, as well as provide additional
 functionality dchroot does not possess.

 different chroots.  A typical installation might provide 'stable',
 'testing' and 'unstable' chroots.  Users can move between chroots as

 .
 This package provides a dchroot-dsa binary which is compatible with
 the command-line options and configuration file format used by the
 dchroot-dsa dchroot maintained by the Debian System Administrators
 used on machines administered for the Debian Project.
 .
 NOTE: the schroot package provides a better implementation of
 dchroot-dsa.  In particular:
  * dchroot-dsa only allows the specification of a single command with
    an absolute path, and no options may be used with the command;
    schroot allows the use of relative and absolute paths with no
    limit on the number of options.
  * dchroot-dsa only allows one chroot to be used at once; schroot will
    allow the use of as many chroots as desired.
  * dchroot-dsa allows access to be restricted to named users; schroot
    implements finer-grained access controls based on users and groups,
    either of which may be granted the ability to gain root access to
    the chroot if required.
 Using schroot will avoid these issues, as well as provide significant
 additional functionality dchroot-dsa does not possess.

 running 32-bit chroots on 64-bit systems, or even running binaries
 from alternative operating systems such as SVR4 or Xenix.
 .
 schroot also integrates with sbuild, to allow building packages with

Description-en: genomic sequence element (kmer) enrichment analysis
 Bacterial genomes vary extensively in terms of both gene content and
 gene sequence - this plasticity hampers the use of traditional SNP-based
 methods for identifying all genetic associations with phenotypic
 variation. SEER provides a computationally scalable and widely
 applicable statistical method for the identification of sequence
 elements that are significantly enriched in a phenotype of interest.
 SEER is applicable to even tens of thousands of genomes by counting variable-
 length k-mers using a distributed string-mining algorithm. Robust
 options are provided for association analysis that also correct for the
 clonal population structure of bacteria. Using large collections of
 genomes of the major human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, SEER
 identifies relevant previously characterised resistance determinants for
 several antibiotics.

Package: sickle
Description-md5: 669442b6169b604f66a4edae2b8390cc
Description-en: windowed adaptive trimming tool for FASTQ files using quality
 Most modern sequencing technologies produce reads that have deteriorating
 quality towards the 3'-end. Incorrectly called bases here negatively impact
 assembles, mapping, and downstream bioinformatics analyses.
 .
 Sickle is a tool that uses sliding windows along with quality and length
 thresholds to determine when quality is sufficiently low to trim the 3'-end
 of reads. It will also discard reads based upon the length threshold. It takes
 the quality values and slides a window across them whose length is 0.1 times
 the length of the read. If this length is less than 1, then the window is set
 to be equal to the length of the read. Otherwise, the window slides along the
 quality values until the average quality in the window drops below the
 threshold. At that point the algorithm determines where in the window the drop
 occurs and cuts both the read and quality strings there. However, if the cut
 point is less than the minimum length threshold, then the read is discarded
 entirely.
 .
 Sickle supports four types of quality values: Illumina, Solexa, Phred, and
 Sanger. Note that the Solexa quality setting is an approximation (the actual
 conversion is a non-linear transformation). The end approximation is close.
 .
 Sickle also supports gzipped file inputs.

    efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
    and Pythonic domain language.
  * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
    connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
    instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
  * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
    objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
    structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
    arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
    load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
    commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
  * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
    generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
    for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
    using Unit of Work.
  * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
    rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
    is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
    an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
    ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

 Surf is a script driven tool to visualize some real algebraic geometry:
 plane algebraic curves, algebraic surfaces and hyperplane sections of
 surfaces.
 .
 The algorithms should be stable enough not to be confused by curve/surface
 singularities in codimension greater than one and the degree of the surface
 or curve. This has been achieved quite a bit. Curves of degree up to 30 and
 surfaces of degree up to 20 have been drawn successfully. However, there are
 examples of curves/surfaces of lower degree where surf fails to produce
 perfect images. This happens especially if the equation of the curve/surface
 is not reduced. Best results are achieved using reduced equations. On the other
 hand, surf displays the Fermat-curves accurately for degree up to 98.
 .

 This dummy package is meant to allow multi-variant support for surf.

Description-en: distributed virtual object store - Python libraries
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) creates redundant, scalable object
 storage using clusters of standardized servers to store petabytes of
 accessible data. It is not a file system or real-time data storage system, but
 rather a long-term storage system for a more permanent type of static data
 that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then updated if necessary. Primary
 examples of data that best fit this type of storage model are virtual machine
 images, photo storage, email storage and backup archiving. Having no central
 "brain" or master point of control provides greater scalability, redundancy
 and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.

Package: libt-digest-java
Description-md5: 66f122eeb099f2b7c4da5fb6e8d311d8
Description-en: Data structure for quantiles and related rank statistics
 The t-digest construction algorithm uses a variant of 1-dimensional
 k-means clustering to product a data structure that is related to the
 Q-digest. This t-digest data structure can be used to estimate
 quantiles or compute other rank statistics. The advantage of the
 t-digest over the Q-digest is that the t-digest can handle floating
 point values while the Q-digest is limited to integers. With small
 changes, the t-digest can handle any values from any ordered set that
 has something akin to a mean. The accuracy of quantile estimates
 produced by t-digests can be orders of magnitude more accurate than
 those produced by Q-digests in spite of the fact that t-digests are
 more compact when stored on disk.

Description-en: Tomcat native library using the Apache Portable Runtime
 Tomcat can use the Apache Portable Runtime to provide superior scalability,
 performance, and better integration with native server technologies.
 The Apache Portable Runtime is a highly portable library that is at the
 heart of Apache HTTP Server 2.x. APR has many uses, including access to

 functionality (random number generation, system status, etc), and native
 process handling (shared memory, NT pipes and Unix sockets).
 .
 These features allows making Tomcat a general purpose webserver, will
 enable much better integration with other native web technologies, and
 overall make Java much more viable as a full fledged webserver platform
 rather than simply a backend focused technology.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

     procfs.
   * Compare info gathered from /bin/ps with info gathered from syscalls
     (syscall scanning).
   * Full PIDs space occupation (PIDs bruteforcing)
   * Reverse search, verify that all thread seen by ps are also seen by the
     kernel (/bin/ps output vs /proc, procfs walking and syscall)
   * Quick compare /proc, procfs walking and syscall vs /bin/ps output
 .
 unhide-tcp identifies TCP/UDP ports that are listening but are not listed in
 /bin/netstat through brute forcing of all TCP/UDP ports available.

 this package if you are using slow Name Services like LDAP, NIS or
 NIS+.
 .
 This particular NSCD is a complete rewrite of the GNU glibc nscd
 which is a single threaded server process which offloads all NSS
 lookups to worker children; cache hits are handled by the parent,
 and only cache misses start worker children, making the parent immune
 to resource leaks, hangs, and crashes in NSS libraries.

 It should mostly be a drop-in replacement for existing installs using
 nscd.

Package: usb-modeswitch
Description-md5: bbddadcef95b9342b7cf75c7d1b5cfa2
Description-en: mode switching tool for controlling "flip flop" USB devices
 Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard,
 especially WAN dongles. When plugged in for the first time, they act
 like a flash storage and start installing the driver from there. If
 the driver is already installed, the storage device vanishes and
 a new device, such as an USB modem, shows up. This is called the
 "ZeroCD" feature.
 .
 On Debian, this is not needed, since the driver is included as a
 Linux kernel module, such as "usbserial". However, the device still
 shows up as "usb-storage" by default. usb-modeswitch solves that
 issue by sending the command which actually performs the switching
 of the device from "usb-storage" to "usbserial".
 .

 like a flash storage and start installing the driver from there. If
 the driver is already installed, the storage device vanishes and
 a new device, such as an USB modem, shows up. This is called the
 "ZeroCD" feature.
 .
 On Debian, this is not needed, since the driver is included as a
 Linux kernel module, such as "usbserial". However, the device still
 shows up as "usb-storage" by default. usb-modeswitch solves that
 issue by sending the command which actually performs the switching
 of the device from "usb-storage" to "usbserial".
 .
 This package contains the commands data needed for usb-modeswitch.

Description-en: Levelling audio filter as command-line tool and LADSPA/JACK plugin
 VLevel keeps your music from making you jump out of your seat, and it
 keeps you from having to fiddle with the volume constantly. It's
 different from other dynamic compressors because it looks ahead. You
 can think of VLevel as someone who knows your music by heart, and
 turns the volume up during quiet passages, but smoothly turns it back
 down when he knows a loud part is coming. It's great for making CDs
 to listen to in your car, or to play background music on your
 computer.
 .
 VLevel is currently a LADSPA plugin, a JACK plugin and a command-line
 filter. You can use it with many Linux audio programs including XMMS,
 GStreamer, GLAME, GDAM, and others, and you can use it in shell
 scripts to level your music before burning a CD.

 Volatility supports memory dumps from all major 32- and 64-bit Windows
 versions and service packs. Whether your memory dump is in raw format,
 a Microsoft crash dump, hibernation file, or virtual machine snapshot,
 Volatility is able to work with it.
 .
 Linux memory dumps in raw or LiME format are supported too. There are
 several plugins for analyzing memory dumps from 32- and 64-bit Linux
 kernels and relevant distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE,
 RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, Mandriva, etc.
 .
 Volatility also support several versions of Mac OSX memory dumps, both
 32- and 64-bit. Android phones with ARM processors are also supported.
 .
 These are some of the data that can be extracted from a memory image:
    - Image information (date, time, CPU count);
    - Running processes;
    - Open network sockets and connections;
    - OS kernel modules loaded;
    - Memory maps for each process;
    - Executables samples;
    - Command history;
    - Suspicious process mappings (i.e. injected code);
    - Passwords, as LM/NTLM hashes and LSA secrets;

Package: websockify
Description-md5: 337cbf4b14d9c875bd13ec09c109dd7e
Description-en: WebSockets support for any application/server
 websockify was formerly named wsproxy and was part of the noVNC project.
 .
 At the most basic level, websockify just translates WebSockets traffic to
 normal socket traffic. Websockify accepts the WebSockets handshake, parses it,
 and then begins forwarding traffic between the client and the target in both
 directions.
 .
 Websockify supports all versions of the WebSockets protocol (Hixie and HyBi).
 The older Hixie versions of the protocol only support UTF-8 text payloads. In
 order to transport binary data over UTF-8 an encoding must used to encapsulate
 the data within UTF-8.
 .
 With Hixie clients, Websockify uses base64 to encode all traffic to and from
 the client. This does not affect the data between websockify and the server.
 .
 With HyBi clients, websockify negotiates whether to base64 encode traffic to
 and from the client via the subprotocol header (Sec-WebSocket-Protocol). The
 valid subprotocol values are 'binary' and 'base64' and if the client sends
 both then the server (the Python implementation) will prefer 'binary'. The
 'binary' subprotocol indicates that the data will be sent raw using binary
 WebSocket frames. Some HyBi clients (such as the Flash fallback and older
 Chrome and iOS versions) do not support binary data which is why the
 negotiation is necessary.

 differences highlighted with colors for easy identification.
 .
 This package provides a number of scripts that are used to perform a variety of
 tasks that all involve getting user verification and feedback using the xxdiff
 graphical differences viewer.
 .
 For example, there are scripts to perform global renaming of strings within a
 large codebase, where each transformed file is viewed by the user with an
 xxdiff, accepted, rejected or merged changes written over the original file
 (file backups are supported).  Also, this infrastructure is mostly provided as
 modules, in order to allow users to write file transformations in Python and to
 leverage this interactive confirmation process.
 .
 There are also scripts that visualize diffs for a number of SCM systems, like
 CVS, Subversion, etc.  This package was born after a number of these useful
 scripts had sprouted, and it became apparent that sharing the common code for
 the scripts would be a great advantage to tools writers.
 .

Package: yorick
Description-md5: b513b8d5ee0f47690595619a758fcf95
Description-en: interpreted language and scientific graphics
 Yorick is an interpreted programming language for:
  * scientific simulations or calculations
  * postprocessing or steering large simulation codes
  * interactive scientific graphics
  * reading, writing, and translating large files of numbers
 .
 The language features a compact syntax for many common array
 operations, so it processes large arrays of numbers very quickly and
 efficiently.  Superficially, yorick code resembles C code, but yorick
 variables are never explicitly declared and have a dynamic scoping
 similar to many Lisp dialects.  The yorick language is designed to be
 typed interactively at a keyboard, as well as stored in files for
 later use.
 .
 This package includes an emacs-based development environment, which
 you can launch by typing M-x yorick in emacs.
 .
 Many add-on packages and plug-ins are available for Yorick (the
 package names begin with "yorick-"). You may want to install the
 yorick-full metapackage which depends on the vast majority of them.
