libmailutils4 for Debian
=============================

Support for PostgreSQL is not enabled for licensing reasons. PostgreSQL
uses OpenSSL for encryption, and due to incompatibilities between the GPL
and the OpenSSL license, it is not possible to link GNU mailutils to
PostgreSQL's client library. Until this is resolved (ie, PostgreSQL
switches to GnuTLS, the package can't add PostgreSQL support.
