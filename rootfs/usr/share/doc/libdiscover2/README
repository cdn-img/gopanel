$Progeny$

This package contains a library and front-end program for retrieving
information about a system's hardware.  It uses system-dependent code
to scan the hardware and system-independent code to query XML data
sources for information about said hardware, the latter being the bulk
of the work.  The Discover program provides a full interface to the
hardware-querying functionality of the library, but not the lower
levels.  Other programs may be introduced in the future to provide
access to these other layers (for querying the XML data sources
separately from the system's hardware, for example).

The Discover package comes with no data of its own.  Data files are
distributed by Progeny and possibly by others.  See
<http://componentizedlinux.org/discover/> for details.

If you have checked out the discover module from CVS, you will need to
configure the build environment.  See buildtools/README and
doctools/README for details.
