Installation
============
Installation is quite straightforward:

cd /usr/src
rm -fv csf.tgz
wget https://download.configserver.com/csf.tgz
tar -xzf csf.tgz
cd csf
sh install.sh

Next, test whether you have the required iptables modules:

perl /usr/local/csf/bin/csftest.pl

Don't worry if you cannot run all the features, so long as the script doesn't
report any FATAL errors

You should not run any other iptables firewall configuration script. For
example, if you previously used APF+BFD you can remove the combination (which
you will need to do if you have them installed otherwise they will conflict):

sh /usr/local/csf/bin/remove_apf_bfd.sh

That's it. You can then configure csf and lfd by reading the documentation and
configuration files in /etc/csf/csf.conf and /etc/csf/readme.txt directly or
through the csf User Interface.

csf installation for cPanel and DirectAdmin is preconfigured to work on those
servers with all the standard ports open.

csf auto-configures your SSH port on installation where it's running on a non-
standard port.

csf auto-whitelists your connected IP address where possible on installation.

You should ensure that kernel logging daemon (klogd) is enabled. Typically, VPS
servers running RedHat/CentOS v5 have this disabled and you should check
/etc/init.d/syslog and make sure that any klogd lines are not commented out. If
you change the file, remember to restart syslog.

See the csf.conf and readme.txt files for more information.


Webmin Module Installation/Upgrade
==================================

To install or upgrade the csf webmin module:

Install csf as above
Install the csf webmin module in:
  Webmin > Webmin Configuration > Webmin Modules >
  From local file > /usr/local/csf/csfwebmin.tgz > Install Module


Uninstallation
==============
Removing csf and lfd is even more simple:

cd /etc/csf
sh uninstall.sh


GD::Graph
=========
This perl module is required for Statistical Graphs available from the csf UI.
It is dependent on graphical libraries being installed for your OS (e.g.
libgd, libpng, etc. which is beyond the scope of this document)

The perl module itself can be installed in a variety of ways, e.g.:

RedHat/CentOS/CloudLinux:
# yum install perl-GDGraph

Debian v6:
# apt-get install libgd-graph-perl

Direct from cpan.org:
# perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan> install GD::Graph
